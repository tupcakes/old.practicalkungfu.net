>It seems since AVG really started gaining popularity as a realistic AV scanner for everyday use, free AV scanners have been popping up all over the place. I&#8217;ve compiled a list of a few that I know about.

Avast  
Avira  
Panda Cloud  
MS Security Essentials  
AVG

I tried Panda Cloud and it works pretty well, however I think I would like to wait for a few more versions before I start trusting it a lot. Personally right now I&#8217;ve been using MS Security Essentials. It uses the same scanning engine that Forefront uses, which I&#8217;ve been pretty happy with. Plus it has relatively low resource utilization, so it doesn&#8217;t bog down your computer.

All of these are good alternatives for the standard Mcafee or Symantec. However I wouldn&#8217;t expect a free version from either of those two companies anytime soon. They have a reputation for being the two leading AV vendors out there and I don&#8217;t think that reputation is in any danger yet.
