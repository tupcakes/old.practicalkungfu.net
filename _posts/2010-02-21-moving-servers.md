>It&#8217;s been a while since I posted. We just got done moving a bunch of servers today to make room for some new SAN hardware. We were using a small metal frame cart to move the servers around. For each move we put the servers on the cart and since they were HP servers we were configuring iLO. Well there were a couple of the servers that had some very erratic behavior. First I couldn&#8217;t get into iLO then I couldn&#8217;t get the video to work. As it turns out the servers were grounding to the cart which was interfering with the hardware. As soon as we took the servers off the cart they worked fine (thankfully). Lesson learned, don&#8217;t sit them on a metal surface like a cart/hand-truck.
