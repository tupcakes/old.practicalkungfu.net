>So a while back someone came to me asking if there was a way to keep people from putting NA in a field on an infopath form where they were supposed to put an IP address. Apparently people liked requesting VM servers without IPs for some reason. ðŸ™‚

> (25\[0-5]|2[0-4\]\[0-9\]|\[01]?[0-9\]\[0-9\]?)\.(25\[0-5]|2[0-4\]\[0-9\]|\[01]?[0-9\]\[0-9\]?)\.(25\[0-5]|2[0-4\]\[0-9\]|\[01]?[0-9\]\[0-9\]?)\.(25\[0-5]|2[0-4\]\[0-9\]|\[01]?[0-9\]\[0-9\]?)
