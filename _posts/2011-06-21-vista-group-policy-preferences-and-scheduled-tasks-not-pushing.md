>So I had need to deploy a wireless profile (and key) to a bunch of Vista machines last week. Since group policy doesn&#8217;t support pushing personal wireless encryption keys I had to do a scheduled task preference that runs a script that calls an import command. The policy worked perfectly on Windows 7 however when I tested on a Vista machine I found that no scheduled task had been created yet.

  Fast forward through many hours of banging my head against the GPMC&#8230;.

  I called MS support and they confirmed that this is a known bug. Apparently Windows vista machines cannot have vista or later scheduled task preferences pushed to them. I was however able to get around the issue by creating a simple, XP era, task using preferences that runs at logon. For some reason the Vista client can receive that correctly.

  So apparently MS is aware of the issue and they are working on a fix&#8230;(deployment date TBD&#8230;.) ðŸ˜‰
