>Well we decieded to go with the Sonicwall E5500 for our new firewall. For the 0 to 1 people that may read this post we are converting from a Secure Computing Sidewinder G2 to the Sonicwall E5500. The sidewinder is a fine device it&#8217;s just really expensive to license, not to mention it is lacking in a few features. (Hopefully the Mcafee purchase of Secure Computer will add some functionality).

The box will arrive later this week, so hopefully I should be able to start playing with it soon.
