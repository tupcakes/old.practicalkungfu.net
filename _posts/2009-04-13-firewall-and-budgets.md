>Like everyone else we are looking at the budget and ways to save. I got some quotes and now I&#8217;m trying to decide between changing from a Sidewinder G2 to a Sonicwall NSA 5000 or a Watchguard x6500e. Right now I&#8217;m leaning more toward the Watchguard because it&#8217;s slightly cheaper and it supports BGP.

I&#8217;ve seen a lot of bashing in internet post toward both products, and a lot of post in favor of them.

Another thing I&#8217;ve been thinking about doing is simply building my own and managing the rule set with [firewall builder](http://www.fwbuilder.org/). I obviously wouldn&#8217;t get the nice AV filtering and IPS built in. But then again free (minus hardware) would be good for our budget. Unless something changes I&#8217;m still leaning more toward the appliance option.
