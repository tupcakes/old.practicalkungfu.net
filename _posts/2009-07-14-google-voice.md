>Well I&#8217;ve been living with Google Voice for a few days now and I love it. I really like having my office phone forwarded to it to handle my work VM. Keeps a nice record of all the VMs I get that I can save for later if needed. (anyone who has worked in IT knows why this is a good thing). I also have my personal phone stuff for my wife and myself forwarded to it, however I may sign up for a dedicated work google voice account when it&#8217;s more freely available.

I also really like not having to enter my long distance dialing code anymore at work. I can just use the google voice service for my long distance.

Thats all for now. Back to setting up a half assed backup solution using openfiler and MS DPM 2007. I&#8217;ll post about it if I can get it working.
