>Here is the message I&#8217;m getting now.

&#8220;DPM has detected a discontinuity in the log chain for storage group First Storage Group on <span style="font-style: italic;">servername</span> since the last synchronization. (ID 30216 Details: Unspecified errror (0x80004005))&#8221;

I&#8217;ve checked the documentation and circular logging is indeed turned off. I&#8217;ll keep poking at it and post if I find a better solution.
