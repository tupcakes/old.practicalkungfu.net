>Well I&#8217;m getting out of higher ed. I&#8217;ve accepted a job at another company in town. I&#8217;ll keep posting when I can (not that I posted much to begin with).

Found this on the sprint forums. Apparently it will allow you to turn off the sense UI on the hero without rooting it. According to the post it provides a major speed boost. I have not confirmed this, but I may try it when I get a chance. I&#8217;m not sure if I would like it without sense UI or not. The sense UI is pretty nice though so I don&#8217;t know if it would be worth running the default home app.

Original post.

&#8220;under Settings, Applications, Manage Applications, HTC Sense, press &#8220;Clear Defaults&#8221;. Then press the home button, tap &#8220;use as default&#8221;, then tap &#8220;Home&#8221;. Then I shut down the Hero and restarted it, just to clear out HTC Sense from memory.&#8221;

UPDATE:  
Well I tried the no sense hack and I&#8217;m happy to report that it works! Major props to <span class="jive-author-avatar-container"></span><a class="jiveTT-hover-user jive-username-link" href="http://community.sprint.com/baw/people/Daveydave;jsessionid=AD75796428527ACF59A573F6BD92138A.app1jive1" id="jive-a301Nt4t6D7i8vQ8" onmouseout="quickuserprofile.cancelTooltip();" onmouseover="quickuserprofile.getUserProfileTooltip(59007);">Daveydave</a> from the sprint forum who found this. Currently when I press the home button the hero will ask me which UI I want to use. Pretty cool. The phone does also feel more responsive. Now on to testing functionality. ðŸ™‚
