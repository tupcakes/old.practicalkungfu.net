Apparently it&#8217;s a reghack that enables policy settings so that a user can login with local admin rights but still launch apps as a restricted user. I&#8217;m not sure what I think about this. This sounds like an intriguing idea, however I&#8217;m not sure how effective it would be at stopping malware in practice. It may slow down malware from the web a bit but I&#8217;m not sure about other attack vectors.
