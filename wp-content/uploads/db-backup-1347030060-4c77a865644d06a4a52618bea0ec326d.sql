Version 1.0 is really worth checking out. I&#8217;m quite proud of it.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://markjaquith.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/screen-shot-2012-07-17-at-12-04-21-pm.png?w=584&h=284\" alt=\"\" title=\"Screen Shot 2012-07-17 at 12.04.21 PM\" width=\"584\" height=\"284\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-3896\" /></p>\n<h3>WP Help</h3>\n<p>WP Help is a plugin for creating documentation for display within the WordPress admin. Many WordPress installs are customized, and it&#8217;s really helpful to have a centralized resource for documenting those features. You can create documents about creating content, editing content, moderating comments, or whatever you want! If you have clients who can&#8217;t seem to remember how to do X, you should install WP Help and document it for them. WP Help is powered by WordPress Custom Post Types, so you create content using the full WordPress editor.</p>\n<h3>Document Syncing</h3>\n<p>Oh yeah. This is the feature you&#8217;ve all been waiting for. If you have a standard set of help documents you want to use on multiple sites, this lets you do that. Create the documents, grab the (secret) sync URL for that site, and then plug that URL in to other sites. Those other sites will automatically pull down those documents, and keep them up-to-date (even handling new documents, deleted documents, renamed documents, and re-parented documents). Any internal links in the original document will be rewritten to be local to the destination WP Help install. So go ahead and use the WP internal linking functionality on your source site and know that those links will work on all the destination sites!</p>\n<h3>Menu Placement</h3>\n<p>The menu item for the help documents can now be placed in one of four locations:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>As a Dashboard submenu</li>\n<li>Top level, above the Dashboard</li>\n<li>Top level, below the Dashboard</li>\n<li>Top level, at the bottom</li>\n</ol>\n<p>You get a live preview of this (yeah, I know, super fancy).</p>\n<h3>Menu Name</h3>\n<p>The menu name (and page title) can be changed. Just doubleclick the page title, edit it, and hit return. Boom. Again, this has a live preview.</p>\n<h3>Topics List Name</h3>\n<p>Likewise the topics list header can be renamed. Doubleclick, edit, return. Live preview.</p>\n<h3>Edit Links &amp; Management Links</h3>\n<p>If you can edit help documents, you&#8217;ll get an edit link. When editing, there is a handy &#8220;Manage&#8221; link to jump you back to the documents management interface. Navigating in general has been improved quite a bit.</p>\n<h3>Dashboard Widget</h3>\n<p>There is now a simple dashboard widget, listing all of your help documents.</p>\n<h3>Better Default Access</h3>\n<p>A lot of you said that you have Contributor-level users who need documentation just like authors do.

Though there are hundreds of people around the globe organizing WordCamps, WordPress meetups, hackathons, free classes and the like, since their &#8220;projects&#8221; were all happening locally there was never a central hub of activity for these folks. Despite the many informal connections between community organizers, we weren&#8217;t taking advantage of the huge existing knowledge base as new organizers stepped up to the plate.</p>\n<p>With the creation of <a href=\"http://make.wordpress.org/events/\">this new contributor group</a>, we finally have a way to organize and recognize these kinds of contributions, a clear avenue for feedback and input when it comes to policies around official events, and the opportunity to create even more connections between community organizers through mentorship programs and group projects. I&#8217;m especially excited about the creation of this group because until now the role of community organizer, while one of the most important, has not gotten the same recognition as higher-profile contribution methods such as forum support or core code contribution. That is something I hope this group will change, and the local organizers can be recognized for the community leaders they are.*</p>\n<p>If you are the organizer of a local WordCamp, WordPress meetup, etc., head over to <a href=\"http://make.wordpress.org/events/\">http://make.wordpress.org/events/</a> and introduce yourself so we can include you in the fun!</p>\n<p>Speaking of meetups, an update on <a href=\"http://wordpress.org/news/2012/01/year-of-the-meetup/\">my last post about meetups</a> is long overdue. With around 500 meetup organizers (and/or potential organizers) responding to my last survey, it took much longer than anticipated to review all the responses. We&#8217;re working now with meetup.com to issue invitations to join a centralized WordPress Meetup account, so if you filled out the form earlier this year, you should be hearing from them soon. The first wave of existing meetup account transfers (for those who opted in) should happen in the next two weeks, with additional waves every 3 months thereafter (and new groups will be able to be created along the way).</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"http://wordpress.org/news/2012/05/calling-all-contributors-community-summit-2012/\">contributor summit</a> that is being planned for the end of October also generated hundreds of responses/nominations, so that review process is still happening, but we should be announcing some basic plans and issuing invitations soon.</p>\n<p>And finally, it would be impossible to talk about in-person WordPress events without mentioning the upcoming annual <a href=\"http://2012.sf.wordcamp.org\">WordCamp in San Francisco</a>. As the event that represents the worldwide project as a whole, it&#8217;s the perfect time to evaluate where we stand as a project and as a community, to help determine where we go next. If you&#8217;re a WordPress user, developer, or in any way a part of our vast and interconnected ecosystem, please take a moment to fill in the <a href=\"http://wpsurvey.polldaddy.com/s/wp-2012\">2nd annual WordPress survey</a>. It&#8217;s just a couple of questions, and your input would be greatly appreciated. The results of the survey will be announced at <a href=\"http://2012.sf.wordcamp.org\">WSCF</a>, and a report issued shortly thereafter.</p>\n<p>Thanks!</p>\n<p>*<em> I am also of the firm belief that academic and arts activities should earn varsity letters just like sports teams do &#8212;

Here I will touch on the converse &#8211; how to make sure your plugin will work nicely if it is loaded by a theme.</p>\n<p>My general approach to development is to create discreet features that can interact with each other in elegant ways. By keeping each set of features small, they are simpler by design and implementation &#8211; this makes both them less prone to bugs and easier to reuse. You can see this approach in action in many of <a href=\"http://crowdfavorite.com/wordpress/\">Crowd Favorite&#8217;s WordPress products</a>. For example we created our <a href=\"http://alexking.org/blog/2011/10/25/wordpress-post-formats-admin-ui\">Admin Post Formats UI</a> as a library that can be easily reused rather than coding that feature into our FavePersonal theme directly.<sup id=\"fnref:1\"><a href=\"http://alexking.org/blog/topic/wordpress/feed#fn:1\" rel=\"footnote\">1</a></sup> Another example, <a href=\"http://crowdfavorite.com/wordpress/carrington-build/\">Carrington Build</a> includes a plugin to enables translation of it&#8217;s data when being pushed from staging to production by <a href=\"http://crowdfavorite.com/wordpress/ramp/\">RAMP</a>.</p>\n<p>If you start with the mindset of &#8220;I&#8217;m creating code to implement a feature, and this code should be as re-usable as possible&#8221;, then you&#8217;re already in good shape.</p>\n<p>Here are some specific things to consider:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Don&#8217;t use activation or deactivation hooks.</strong> There are actually lots of reasons why these are a bad idea, including multi-site considerations, upgrade considerations, etc. Instead, pick an opportune time to do a lightweight check to see if your plugin set-up needs to be run (perhaps check the existence of one of your settings &#8211; perhaps an &#8220;installed version&#8221; setting) and do the work you need to do at that time. Remember, you want to do these checks in admin hooks rather than front-end hooks &#8211; you don&#8217;t want to add unnecessary overhead to every public page load and you want to avoid race conditions.<sup id=\"fnref:2\"><a href=\"http://alexking.org/blog/topic/wordpress/feed#fn:2\" rel=\"footnote\">2</a></sup></li>\n<li><strong>Don&#8217;t reply on your code running prior to all code being loaded.</strong> Hook in at <code>wp_loaded</code> (previously this was done at <code>init</code>) to do any set-up work, etc. The only situation where this might not be possible is if you need to <a href=\"http://alexking.org/blog/2012/07/09/include-plugin-in-wordpress-theme#comment-220953\">override a pluggable function</a>, but the types of plugins that need to do this are (in my experience) less likely to be the type of plugin included in a theme.</li>\n<li><strong>Don&#8217;t rely on settings existing in the database.</strong> This ties in with the first consideration as I often see default settings written to the database as part of the activation process. I take the approach of creating an accessor function in my plugin that holds a set of defaults for settings.

We made significant improvements to Extras callbacks to allow standalone comparison data, and we released a fully documented RAMP plugin skeleton and an example plugin. The RAMP process is somewhat complex, so hopefully these examples will help other developers extend RAMP for their needs. We also added a developer package that includes support for unlimited sites.</p>\n<p>We also added support for non-public post types by default, improved the error checking for staging/production server connection issues and made a variety of changes for WordPress 3.4 compatibility.</p>\n<p>If you are working on a WordPress site where you need to maintain staging and production environments, RAMP may be a solution for you.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue,

Most importantly we did it in a way that still allows the Social plugin to be installed and updated independently. We made sure that we implemented this in a manner that:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>respected users&#8217; expectations</li>\n<li>allowed users to manage the plugin independently of the theme</li>\n</ol>\n<p>I thought it might be useful to outline the approach we used in a little detail in case others might want to do something similar.</p>\n<p>At <a href=\"http://crowdfavorite.com\">Crowd Favorite</a> we believe strongly in the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_least_astonishment\">principle of least astonishment</a>. WordPress users expect to be able to download and install plugins whenever they see something that looks interesting. We wanted to make sure that we didn&#8217;t impede this process. So even though FavePersonal includes the Social plugin, we wanted to make sure we accounted for situations where Social was already installed on a site before FavePersonal was activated; as well as handling a situation where someone installs and activates the Social plugin once FavePersonal is already installed.<sup id=\"fnref:1\"><a href=\"http://alexking.org/blog/topic/wordpress/feed#fn:1\" rel=\"footnote\">1</a></sup></p>\n<h2>Foundation</h2>\n<p>When including a plugin in a theme, the main thing you want to avoid is a situation where the same PHP code is processed twice. This will trigger a fatal error (often times resulting in the white screen of death). In other words, don&#8217;t just <code>include()</code> the plugin in your theme. If someone already has that plugin activated on their site, you&#8217;d have the &#8220;loaded twice&#8221; issue (and your site would crash).</p>\n<p>To avoid this situation, it&#8217;s useful to look at the WordPress load process (in wp-settings.php, referencing WP 3.4.1). The first thing WordPress does is <a href=\"http://core.trac.wordpress.org/browser/tags/3.4.1/wp-settings.php#L108\">load in its core functionality</a>:</p>\n<pre><code>// Load most of WordPress.\nrequire( ABSPATH .

So let&#8217;s do it.</p>\n<h2>Implementation</h2>\n<p>Since the theme is loading in last, we can use that to our advantage. If the plugin has been installed separately as a plugin (and not as part of the theme), we will be able to see that it is active. If it is already active, we don&#8217;t want to load it again a second time.</p>\n<p><p>View the code on <a href=\"https://gist.github.com/3060451\">Gist</a>.</p></p>\n<p>In our FavePersonal theme we added an additional check in the <code>if</code> statement to see if the setting to activate the Social plugin was turned on. This allows us to avoid loading the plugin if the site owner has decided to disable this functionality.</p>\n<p>There you have it &#8211; very simple, the plugin will only be loaded by the theme if it hasn&#8217;t been activated separately as a plugin, and the plugin is properly in place before <a href=\"http://core.trac.wordpress.org/browser/tags/3.4.1/wp-settings.php#L302\"><code>init</code></a> or <a href=\"http://core.trac.wordpress.org/browser/tags/3.4.1/wp-settings.php#L323\"><code>wp_loaded</code></a> (where plugins commonly do set-up work).</p>\n<div class=\"footnotes\">\n<hr

looks like after <a href=\"http://www.wptavern.com/forum/themes-templates/494-standard-theme-hook-names.html\">three years since the discussion took place on the WPTavern forums</a> regarding the standardization of theme hooks, Doug Stewart has decided to put together a <a href=\"https://github.com/zamoose/themehookalliance\">Theme Hook Alliance project</a> to get theme authors all on the same page. </p>\n<blockquote><p>Child theme authors and plugin developers need a consistent set of entry points to allow for easy customization and altering of functionality. Core WordPress offers a suite of [action hooks](<a href=\"http://codex.wordpress.org/Plugin_API/Action_Reference/\">http://codex.wordpress.org/Plugin_API/Action_Reference/</a>) and [template tags](<a href=\"http://codex.wordpress.org/Template_tags\">http://codex.wordpress.org/Template_tags</a>) but does not cover many of the common use cases. The Theme Hook Alliance is a community-driven effort to agree on a set of third-party action hooks that THA themes pledge to implement in order to give that desired consistency.</p></blockquote>\n<p>It will be interesting to see how far this goes and what the adoption rate will be like. Doug is looking for some feedback so if you&#8217;re keen to the idea, let him know in the comments of his blog post. </p>\n<p>No related posts.</p><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/WordpressTavern/~4/gUS1wSHqEWY\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" />\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 06 Jul 2012 10:15:13 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:6:\"Jeffro\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:33;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:59:\"WPTavern: New Site Dedicated To Reviewing WordPress Plugins\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"http://www.wptavern.com/?p=6613\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:111:\"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/WordpressTavern/~3/3gujwBvYkhI/new-site-dedicated-to-reviewing-wordpress-plugins\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:959:\"<p><a href=\"http://www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/wpnuggetslogo.png\" rel=\"thumbnail\"><img src=\"http://www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/wpnuggetslogo.png\" alt=\"wpnuggets logo\" title=\"wpnuggetslogo\" width=\"256\" height=\"58\" class=\"alignright size-full wp-image-6614\" /></a> For those of you looking for in-depth reviews of both paid and free WordPress plugins, you may want to add <a href=\"http://wpnuggets.com/\">WPNuggets.com</a> to your feedreader or bookmarks.

Though there are hundreds of people around the globe organizing WordCamps, WordPress meetups, hackathons, free classes and the like, since their &#8220;projects&#8221; were all happening locally there was never a central hub of activity for these folks. Despite the many informal connections between community organizers, we weren&#8217;t taking advantage of the huge existing knowledge base as new organizers stepped up to the plate.</p>\n<p>With the creation of <a href=\"http://make.wordpress.org/events/\">this new contributor group</a>, we finally have a way to organize and recognize these kinds of contributions, a clear avenue for feedback and input when it comes to policies around official events, and the opportunity to create even more connections between community organizers through mentorship programs and group projects. I&#8217;m especially excited about the creation of this group because until now the role of community organizer, while one of the most important, has not gotten the same recognition as higher-profile contribution methods such as forum support or core code contribution. That is something I hope this group will change, and the local organizers can be recognized for the community leaders they are.*</p>\n<p>If you are the organizer of a local WordCamp, WordPress meetup, etc., head over to <a href=\"http://make.wordpress.org/events/\">http://make.wordpress.org/events/</a> and introduce yourself so we can include you in the fun!</p>\n<p>Speaking of meetups, an update on <a href=\"http://wordpress.org/news/2012/01/year-of-the-meetup/\">my last post about meetups</a> is long overdue. With around 500 meetup organizers (and/or potential organizers) responding to my last survey, it took much longer than anticipated to review all the responses. We&#8217;re working now with meetup.com to issue invitations to join a centralized WordPress Meetup account, so if you filled out the form earlier this year, you should be hearing from them soon. The first wave of existing meetup account transfers (for those who opted in) should happen in the next two weeks, with additional waves every 3 months thereafter (and new groups will be able to be created along the way).</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"http://wordpress.org/news/2012/05/calling-all-contributors-community-summit-2012/\">contributor summit</a> that is being planned for the end of October also generated hundreds of responses/nominations, so that review process is still happening, but we should be announcing some basic plans and issuing invitations soon.</p>\n<p>And finally, it would be impossible to talk about in-person WordPress events without mentioning the upcoming annual <a href=\"http://2012.sf.wordcamp.org\">WordCamp in San Francisco</a>. As the event that represents the worldwide project as a whole, it&#8217;s the perfect time to evaluate where we stand as a project and as a community, to help determine where we go next. If you&#8217;re a WordPress user, developer, or in any way a part of our vast and interconnected ecosystem, please take a moment to fill in the <a href=\"http://wpsurvey.polldaddy.com/s/wp-2012\">2nd annual WordPress survey</a>. It&#8217;s just a couple of questions, and your input would be greatly appreciated. The results of the survey will be announced at <a href=\"http://2012.sf.wordcamp.org\">WSCF</a>, and a report issued shortly thereafter.</p>\n<p>Thanks!</p>\n<p>*<em> I am also of the firm belief that academic and arts activities should earn varsity letters just like sports teams do &#8212; go mathletes! </em></p>\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:36:\"http://wellformedweb.org/CommentAPI/\";a:1:{s:10:\"commentRss\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:62:\"http://wordpress.org/news/2012/07/event-organizers-unite/feed/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:38:\"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/slash/\";a:1:{s:8:\"comments\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:1:\"0\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:1;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:45:\"\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n				\n		\n\n		\n		\n				\n			\n		\n		\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:5:{s:0:\"\";a:7:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:48:\"WordPress 3.4.1 Maintenance and Security Release\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:50:\"http://wordpress.org/news/2012/06/wordpress-3-4-1/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:8:\"comments\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:59:\"http://wordpress.org/news/2012/06/wordpress-3-4-1/#comments\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 27 Jun 2012 19:57:46 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:8:\"category\";a:2:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:8:\"Releases\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:1;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:8:\"Security\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:33:\"http://wordpress.org/news/?p=2383\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:1:{s:0:\"\";a:1:{s:11:\"isPermaLink\";s:5:\"false\";}}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:379:\"WordPress 3.4.1 is now available for download.

For themes that support it, you can change colors, backgrounds, and of course custom image headers. We have more planned for the customizer down the road.</p>\n<p>Throughout the rest of the admin you&#8217;ll notice tweaks to make your everyday life easier. For example, if you have lots of themes we&#8217;ve made it quicker to browse them all at once without paging. We&#8217;ve made it possible to use images from your media library to populate custom headers, and for you to choose the height and width of your header images.</p>\n<p>We&#8217;ve expanded our embed support to include tweets: just put a Twitter permalink on its own line in the post editor and we&#8217;ll turn it into a beautiful embedded Tweet. And finally, image captions have been improved to allow HTML, like links, in them.</p>\n<h3>For Developers</h3>\n<p>There are hundreds of under-the-hood improvements in this release, notably in the XML-RPC, themes, and custom header APIs, and significant performance improvements in WP_Query and the translation system. <a href=\"http://codex.wordpress.org/Version_3.4\">The Codex has a pretty good summary of the developer features</a>, and you can always <a href=\"http://core.trac.wordpress.org/milestone/3.4\">dive into Trac directly</a>.</p>\n<p>We&#8217;ve also <a href=\"http://wpdevel.wordpress.com/2012/06/07/wordpress-3-4-field-guide-for-developers/\">put together a busy developer&#8217;s field guide to the new APIs in 3.4</a>.</p>\n<h3>It takes a village</h3>\n<p>Here are some of the fine folks who were involved in bringing 3.4 to the world:</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://profiles.wordpress.org/082net\">082net</a>, <a href=\"http://profiles.wordpress.org/aaroncampbell\">Aaron D.

There are over <a href=\"http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/\">19,000 plugins listed</a> and they&#8217;re really the heart and soul of WordPress for many people, so they deserve a little tender loving care. Here&#8217;s a quick before and after snapshot you can zoom in on to see a visual overview of some of the changes:</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://wpdotorg.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/contact-form-7.png\"><img src=\"http://s2.wp.com/imgpress?resize=690,350&amp;url=http://wpdotorg.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/contact-form-7.png&amp;unsharpmask=80,0.5,3\" alt=\"\" /></a></p>\n<p>Our first focus was around improving the discussion and support around plugins.</p>\n<p>You&#8217;ll now notice that threads about a plugin are pulled directly into a &#8220;support&#8221; tab on the plugin page &#8212; each plugin has its own forum. We&#8217;ve made authors much more prominent and with bigger Gravatars and better placement, so you can get a sense of who made the plugin you&#8217;re using. And finally to show how active and well-supported a plugin is, you can see  &#8221;16 of 75 support threads in the last two weeks have been resolved.&#8221; Finally, if you&#8217;re logged in you get access to the new &#8220;favorites&#8221; feature that lets you mark the plugins you use the most so you can share them on your profile page and find them quickly later. We soft-launched favorites a few days ago and there have already been 2,000 saved!</p>\n<p>If you&#8217;re a plugin author, we&#8217;ve started with a short threshold (2 weeks) for the resolved stats so it&#8217;s easy to catch up and stay on top of it. (It&#8217;ll eventually go to two months.) You also now have the ability to set stickies on your plugin forum to put FAQs or important information at the top, and of course any person you put as a committer on the plugin will have moderation access. People on the forum tag will see your custom header and links to the other resources attached to your plugin.</p>\n<p>We&#8217;ve tightened up the styling a bit on the forums and plugin pages, though still some cleanups to do there. Some older improvements you might have missed, but are still useful for users and developers alike:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>&#8220;Plugin headers&#8221; or those cool graphics you see at the top of plugin pages have really taken off, there are over 1,600 active now.</li>\n<li>You can now subscribe to get an email whenever a commit is made to a plugin repository even if it isn&#8217;t yours. There is no better way to follow the development of your favorite plugins.

As annual events go, it&#8217;s easily my favorite. Don&#8217;t get me wrong, I love attending <a title=\"WordCamp Central\" href=\"http://wordcamp.org\">WordCamps</a> and local <a title=\"WordPress on Meetup.com\" href=\"http://wordpress.meetup.com/\">WordPress meetups</a> (which are awesome and you should try to attend if you are able), but at the core team meetup, the focus on working together and getting things done is unique, as is the experience of every person in the room being so highly qualified. This year, instead of just planning a core team meetup, I&#8217;m aiming a little higher and shooting for a full-on contributor/community summit.</p>\n<p>Core code isn&#8217;t the only way to contribute to the WordPress project. We have an active <a title=\"Theme Review Team blog\" href=\"http://make.wordpress.org/themes/\">theme review team</a>, <a href=\"http://wordpress.org/support/\">support forum</a> volunteers, people writing <a href=\"http://codex.wordpress.org/Main_Page\">documentation</a>, plugin managers, community event organizers, translators, and more. The teams have been siloed for too long, so we&#8217;ve recently begun the process of bringing them together by having teams elect representatives to facilitate more communication between the contributor groups. These reps will form the nucleus of the contributor summit now being planned for a long weekend at the end of October in Tybee Island, GA. This is completely different from a WordCamp. It will be a combination of co-working, unconference, and discussions among the project leaders, and participation will be by invitation.</p>\n<p>In addition to bringing together the active contributor team reps to work together, I think it&#8217;s important to include community members who don&#8217;t fall into that category (at least not yet!). Successful WordPress-based business, authors of popular plugins and themes, and people using WordPress in unexpected but intriguing ways should have a place at the table, too. That said, part of the magic of the core team meetup is the small size; it allows every voice not only to be heard, but to engage. Since this is my first attempt at bringing together so many groups and points of view, I want to try and keep it small enough to retain that personal atmosphere while at the same time ensuring that the best possible mix of people and businesses in the WordPress ecosystem is represented. This is where you come in!</p>\n<p>Taking a cue from events with limited availability like <a title=\"AdaCamp\" href=\"http://dc.adacamp.org/\">AdaCamp</a> (attendance) and the <a title=\"jQuery Conference\" href=\"http://events.jquery.org/2012/sf/\">jQuery conference</a> (speaker roster), I want you to <a title=\"Nomination survey\" href=\"http://wordpressdotorg.polldaddy.com/s/2012-community-summit-nominations\">nominate people and/or WordPress-based businesses to participate in the summit</a>. Yes, you can nominate yourself.* You can nominate up to 10 additional people &#8212; be prepared to provide URLs and the reason you think they should participate. You can also nominate up to 10 WordPress-based businesses without naming individual people, so if there&#8217;s a theme or hosting company (for example) that you think should be there, you don&#8217;t need to go looking for employee names. This nomination process will hopefully ensure that we don&#8217;t overlook someone who is making a difference in our community when it comes time to issue invitations.</p>\n<p>Nominations will be open for a week, after which <a href=\"http://wordpressdotorg.polldaddy.com/s/2012-community-summit-nominations\">the survey</a> will be closed and the process of analyzing the results** will begin. The nominations process will lead to invitations in June, confirmations in July, planning in August and September, and the summit itself in October. Hopefully we can stream and/or record some of the activity to share online at <a href=\"http://wordpress.tv\">WordPress.tv</a>. Additional invitations may be extended up until the event if there are people/businesses that become more active in the community. If you&#8217;re thinking to yourself that maybe now&#8217;s the perfect time to start <a href=\"http://codex.wordpress.org/Contributing_to_WordPress\">contributing time to the WordPress project</a>, good thinking! In the meantime, if you want to weigh in, <a href=\"http://wordpressdotorg.polldaddy.com/s/2012-community-summit-nominations\">fill in the community summit nomination form</a>. Thanks, and wish us luck!</p>\n<p><em>* Nominating yourself: Do nominate yourself if you fall into one of the categories described in the post above, or if you believe that you have a unique point of view. Please do not nominate yourself if you just think it would be cool to hang out with this group. This is a working event, and everyone is expected to bring something special to the table.</em></p>\n<p><em>** I (and/or a helpful community volunteer) will sift through the nominations and compile a shortlist of the most-nominated people/businesses and the most intriguing underdogs.

That&#8217;s super awesome news as it means that the implementation I did in my <a\nhref=\"http://yoast.com/wordpress/seo/\">WordPress SEO plugin</a> works.</p><p>Of course I had to do some tweaking afterwards, because as it turns out Twitter&#8217;s scraper for the Twitter Card data is easily confused (it doesn&#8217;t understand how to parse multiple og:images meta tags). But let me show you what it means if it works well; if you tweet an article from this site, you&#8217;ll see a normal tweet with a new &#8220;View Summary&#8221; link:</p><p><img\nclass=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-45983\" title=\"Tweet with summary button\" src=\"http://cdn3.yoast.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/tweet-summary-button.png\" alt=\"Tweet with summary button\" width=\"513\" height=\"88\" /></p><p>When you click that View summary link, the link &#8220;expands&#8221; and you&#8217;ll see this, the complete Twitter Card:</p><p><img\nclass=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-45982\" title=\"Expanded Twitter Card\" src=\"http://cdn3.yoast.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/twitter-expanded-twitter-card.png\" alt=\"Expanded Twitter Card\" width=\"513\" height=\"314\" /></p><p>As you might notice my Twitter account is there twice, the top one is because I&#8217;m the author of that article, the second one is because I set the @yoast account as the main account for this site. So if you see an article tweeted that&#8217;s been written by Michiel, you&#8217;ll see his twitter account on top and the main @yoast account in the bottom:</p><p><img\nclass=\"size-full wp-image-45984 alignnone\" title=\"Twitter Card Michiel\" src=\"http://cdn3.yoast.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/twitter-card-michiel.png\" alt=\"Twitter Card Michiel\" width=\"448\" height=\"187\" /></p><h2>Can I have Twitter Cards for my site?</h2><p>I know you&#8217;re asking yourself that question. I tested some sites that are running my SEO plugin on which I knew the Twitter Cards implementation in it is activated, but unfortunately couldn&#8217;t find any working examples outside of my own site yet. It seems that you really have to <a\nhref=\"https://dev.twitter.com/form/participate-twitter-cards\">apply to participate</a> with your site next to having the functionality active on your site (you can activate it on the SEO -&gt; Social menu).</p><p>So, the next step is another update of my SEO plugin which improves a bit on the current Twitter Card implementation now that I can test properly, expect that somewhere early next week. This update will also rely on OpenGraph when activated too where possible so you don&#8217;t have another 10 lines of Twitter meta data but instead only 3 or 4 lines for Twitter and the rest of the data coming from OpenGraph. Looking forward to seeing this work on other sites that run my SEO plugin!</p><p><a\nhref=\"http://yoast.com/twitter-cards-in-action/\">Twitter Cards in action</a> is a post by <a\nrel=\"author\" href=\"http://yoast.com/author/joost/\">Joost de Valk</a> on <a\nhref=\"http://yoast.com\">Yoast - Tweaking Websites</a>.A good WordPress blog needs good hosting, you don\'t want your blog to be slow, or, even worse, down, do you?

Whether they are taxonomy or category archives, like this <a\nhref=\"http://yoast.com/cat/seo/\">SEO category</a>, Custom Post Type archives like this one for our <a\nhref=\"http://yoast.com/wp-plugin-review/\">WordPress plugin reviews</a> or my <a\nhref=\"http://yoast.com/speaking/\">speaking engagements</a>, or even date archives: they all share the same common traits. In WordPress an archive will, by default, consist only of a listing of posts. As these pages will get visited by normal people, that means those visitors are &#8220;thrown&#8221; upon a page that doesn&#8217;t try to tell them where they are.</p><p>This lack of introduction gives visitors only two options: leave immediately because they don&#8217;t understand where they&#8217;ve ended up, or click through to an article, without you having had <em>any</em> chance of pushing them in the right direction.</p><p>Because of that, every decent archive needs an &#8220;introduction&#8221;. This can be as simple as just a header that stands out, but for more important sections of your site, it actually pays of to write a bit of content.</p><p>Before you write that content though, you first have to make sure that the content you write actually displays on those archive pages.</p><h2>Show introductory content on archive pages</h2><h3>Categories, Tags and Custom Taxonomies</h3><p>For category, tag or custom taxonomy archives, you can simply create a custom template by creating a file. For categories, for instance, this file would be called category.php. If you don&#8217;t know how template hierarchy works within WordPress, check out <a\nhref=\"http://yoast.com/wordpress-theme-anatomy/\">our infographic</a> on the topic.</p><p>In this template, above the standard WordPress loop, you add the following code:</p><pre class=\"brush: php; title: ; notranslate\">&lt;!--?php if ( !get_query_var( \'paged\' ) ) { ?--&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\n&lt;h1&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;\n&lt;pre&gt;\n  &lt;!--?php echo wpautop( term_description() ); ?--&gt;\n&lt;!--?php } ?--&gt;</pre><p>This uses the title you set for the category / tag / custom taxonomy, as well as the description, which you can fill in the WordPress backend.</p><p>If you uses <a\nhref=\"http://yoast.com/wp-theme/genesis/\">Genesis</a>, you don&#8217;t need to create an extra file, you can probably just check the box in your Genesis theme settings:</p><p><img\nclass=\"alignnone\" title=\"Genesis Archive Settings\" src=\"http://cdn3.yoast.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/genesis-archive-settings.png\" alt=\"Genesis Archive Settings\" width=\"575\" height=\"99\" /></p><p>Or if that doesn&#8217;t work, you can just add this to your child theme&#8217;s functions.php (there&#8217;s still no need to make that file):</p><pre class=\"brush: php; title: ; notranslate\">&lt;!--?php &lt;br ?--&gt;function yoast_term_archive_intro() {\n  if ( !is_category() &amp;&amp; !is_tag() &amp;&amp; !is_tax() )\n    return;\n\n  if( get_query_var( \'paged\' ) )\n    return;\n\n  echo \'&lt;/pre&gt;\n&lt;h1 class=&quot;entry-title&quot;&gt;\'.single_term_title(\'\', false).\'&lt;/h1&gt;\n&lt;pre&gt;\n\';\n  echo \'&lt;/pre&gt;\n&lt;div class=&quot;entry-content&quot;&gt;\'.wpautop( term_description() ).\'&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;pre&gt;\n\';\n}\nadd_action( \'genesis_before_loop\', \'yoast_term_archive_intro\', 20 );</pre><p>Of course you can add some extra code or classes in there to style those boxes a bit more.</p><h3>Custom Post Type archives</h3><p>For custom post type archives, this might actually be a bit harder. The beginning of the process is the same: you can create a new file, the name of which should contain your post type: <em>archive-{posttype}.php</em>.</p><p>Then you could output the name of the post type using the following code:</p><pre class=\"brush: php; title: ; notranslate\">if ( !get_query_var( \'paged\' ) ) {\n$pt = get_post_type_object( get_post_type() );\necho \'&lt;/pre&gt;\n&lt;h1&gt;\'.$pt-&gt;labels-&gt;name.\'&lt;/h1&gt;\n&lt;pre&gt;\n\';\n}</pre><p>This is where the tricky bit comes in though: there is no backend in WordPress to input descriptions for these types of pages, nor is there a preferred way of storing that data. I added input fields for these to my Genesis child theme settings, which is too much to explain here, of course you could also hardcode it but that&#8217;s a bit ugly&#8230;</p><p>Within Genesis, with the data coming from my child theme settings, I output the text using the following code in my functions.php (again, no reason to create a new file):</p><pre class=\"brush: php; title: ; notranslate\">&lt;!--?php &lt;br ?--&gt;function yoast_cpt_intro() {\n  if ( !is_post_type_archive() )\n    return;\n\n  if( get_query_var( \'paged\' ) )\n    return;\n\n  $pt = get_post_type();\n  if ( genesis_get_option( $pt.\'-title\', \'child-settings\' ) ) {\n    echo \'&lt;/pre&gt;\n&lt;h1&gt;\'.genesis_get_option( $pt.\'-title\', \'child-settings\' ).\'&lt;/h1&gt;\n&lt;pre&gt;\n\';\n    echo wpautop( genesis_get_option( $pt.\'-intro\', \'child-settings\' ) );\n  }\n}\nadd_action( \'genesis_before_loop\', \'yoast_cpt_intro\', 20 );</pre><h2>Prevent duplicate content</h2><p>To avoid <a\nhref=\"http://yoast.com/articles/duplicate-content/\">duplicate content</a>, we only add the introduction to the first page of an archive, if that archive is a paginated one. With the introduction of <a\nhref=\"http://yoast.com/rel-next-prev-paginated-archives/\">rel=&#8221;next&#8221; and rel=&#8221;previous&#8221;</a>, sites that have implemented this well will be getting more visitors to the first page of a paginated series of archives anyway, but we still don&#8217;t want to show the same content on multiple pages.</p><p>You might have noticed this line of code in the Genesis examples above:</p><pre class=\"brush: php; title: ; notranslate\">if( get_query_var( \'paged\' ) )\nreturn;</pre><p>This does exactly that: prevent the duplicate content.</p><h2>Styling the archive introduction text</h2><p>You should make sure that your introductory text for your archive really stands out. Remember, it&#8217;s not &#8220;just&#8221; there for SEO reasons, it&#8217;s there because people will read it! It&#8217;s very tempting to make it look just like another post, but you should take a bit more time and style it properly.</p><p>I personally like the way we&#8217;ve done that in our recent redesign, this is for instance what the <a\nhref=\"http://yoast.com/cat/wordpress/\">WordPress category</a> intro looks like:</p><p><img\nclass=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-45947\" title=\"WordPress category introduction\" src=\"http://cdn3.yoast.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/wordpress-category-introduction.png\" alt=\"WordPress category introduction\" width=\"560\" height=\"187\" /></p><p>Of course, the text for that introduction is a bit poor.

So when you Google yourself and instead of twitter.com, you see a weird result, you think &#8220;huh&#8221;. Then, when you&#8217;re like me, you try to figure out what caused that and once you figure it, you think &#8220;d0h!&#8221;. You&#8217;d think the people at Twitter would know better than to use relative URLs or even worse, a HOST header to determine the domain, resulting in this result when you search for my name:</p><p><img\nclass=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-45910\" title=\"yoast - twitter\" src=\"http://cdn.yoast.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/yoast-twitter.png\" alt=\"yoast - twitter\" width=\"522\" height=\"83\" /></p><p>Relative URLs stink. They really do. All sorts of SEO problems on the web are caused by the use of relative URLs in links, canonicals and more. We find issues with them in our <a\nhref=\"http://yoast.com/hire-me/website-review/\">website reviews</a> on a regular basis, but as you can see bigger sites like Twitter also have massive issues because of them. I&#8217;ll try to explain why you shouldn&#8217;t use them and what you could do instead, as it might be simple things like this that hold you back from performing well with your website.</p><h2>What are relative URLs?</h2><p>Relative URLs are all URLs that do not contain a fully qualified domain name and path, but instead just the path or a portion of the path. So when your website is example.com, you could be linking to your contact page from your homepage like this:</p><pre class=\"brush: xml; title: ; notranslate\">&lt;a href=&quot;contact.html&quot;&gt;Contact&lt;/a&gt;</pre><p>And back to your homepage from your contact page like this:</p><pre class=\"brush: xml; title: ; notranslate\">&lt;a href=&quot;/&quot;&gt;Home&lt;/a&gt;</pre><p>The / refers to the directory / on the domain. So even when you&#8217;re three levels deep in a directory structure, linking to / would link to the frontpage. Lastly, when you&#8217;re on the corporate page of your about section, for instance <em>example.com/about/corporate.html</em>, you could link to your contact page like this:</p><pre class=\"brush: xml; title: ; notranslate\">&lt;a href=&quot;../contact.html&quot;&gt;Contact&lt;/a&gt;</pre><p>All the resulting URLs are calculated by your browser based on the base URL. By default, this is the current URL that&#8217;s in your location bar, but using the <code>base</code> element, you could set it to something else, like this:</p><pre class=\"brush: xml; title: ; notranslate\">&lt;base href=&quot;http://www.example.com/subdirectory/&quot;&gt;</pre><p>Doing this would make the second link above, the link to /, resolve to <em>http://www.example.com/subdirectory/</em>.</p><p>This was all fine when HTML was invented and websites consisted of real static HTML pages in directory structures. Now though, most of the web is built with content management systems, changing URLs is easier and some URLs might behave differently than what you&#8217;d expect. Because of that, relative URLs can cause a few different types of issues, all of which can be pretty detrimental for your SEO and your server performance.</p><h3>Why are relative URLs still being used?</h3><p>Relative URLs are often used because developers have a test environment on another hostname and it makes it easy for them to move stuff between their test environment and their live environment. Other reasons include that it&#8217;s &#8220;just easier in website maintenance&#8221;. They&#8217;re also, in my opinion falsely, <a\nhref=\"http://www.websiteoptimization.com/speed/tweak/relative/\">promoted</a> by some websites about site speed because they&#8217;re &#8220;shorter&#8221; and thus &#8220;faster&#8221;.</p><p>In reality, all of these reasons are false when you look at the bigger picture. The few minutes a developer might save by using relative URLs are offset by countless hours an SEO might be spending to solve the issues caused.</p><h2>Some of the problems caused by relative URLs</h2><p>Issues caused by the use of relative URLs are vast and plentiful, and any seasoned SEO can probably give you a few examples of clients that have had huge losses because of them. Let me show you a couple of them:</p><h3>A completely indexed test environment</h3><p>When you have a menu structure that relies on relative URLs, one wrong link in your content to your test environment would cause the entire test environment to be spidered and indexed, causing massive <a\nhref=\"http://yoast.com/articles/duplicate-content/\">duplicate content issues</a>. This happens more often than you think, in fact, have you checked whether the test environment you used to test your last few development projects are indexed by Google? I bet some of you will now find out that they are indexed.</p><h3>Spider traps</h3><p>Most of the times I&#8217;ve found what we call &#8220;spider traps&#8221; they&#8217;re caused by wrongly used relative URLs. Let me show you an example: a site linking to ./example instead of ../example/, from the /contact/ page. A link to ./ means you&#8217;re linking to the current directory. When the current URL ends in /contact/ this means that a link to ./example/ resolves to /contact/example/. So clicking that link would take me to http://www.example.com/contact/example/, if your CMS is set up to serve the same page for /contact/example/ as it serves for /contact/, which is a <em>very</em> common case, you&#8217;ll now have a spider trap. Because that /content/example/ page also links to ./example/, which now resolves to /contact/example/example/, which then links to ./example/ again and thus links to /contact/example/example/example/ etc. etc. etc. You probably get the issue, and I hope you also understand why this could be <em>very</em> detrimental for your search engine rankings.</p><p>These kinds of issues are <em>very</em> easily found using a tool like <a\nhref=\"http://www.screamingfrog.co.uk/seo-spider/\">Screaming Frog</a>, which I think every webmaster should have in its arsenal.</p><h3>Relative canonical URLs</h3><p>Issues can also be caused by using relative canonical URLs. A <a\nhref=\"http://yoast.com/canonical-url-links/\">canonical URL</a> is supposed to link to the &#8220;perfect&#8221; URL for a piece of content on your website. If you use a relative link and also have a subdomain or test environment that&#8217;s indexed, you suddenly have several versions of a piece of content that all proclaim themselves as the canonical version of that piece of content&#8230; You can understand a search engine having a hard time dealing with this.</p><h4>A little knowledge is a dangerous thing&#8230;</h4><p>At Twitter, they figured out that they shouldn&#8217;t use relative canonicals. So a developer there thought he was smart and probably defined the domain part of the canonical URL using the HOST header information. This causes the very issue that I talked about in the introduction above, because now the IP result in the screenshot above has a canonical URL pointing to itself, causing Google to show Twitter&#8217;s IP&#8217;s in search results everywhere instead of the proper domain&#8230;</p><h3>Protocol-relative URLs</h3><p>Another issue is the so-called protocol relative URL. This is a URL that leaves of the http:// or https:// bit. This type of relative URL does have its uses, but it should not be deployed outside of those useful cases. The useful cases are when it&#8217;s used inside JavaScript or CSS, so files are served over the same protocol as the current page, especially because when you&#8217;re on a https URL, serving anything over http basically breaks the security. Using protocol relative URLs within links or canonical URLs is a <em>very bad idea</em> though, because you can still have duplicate content issues between http and https versions of a website.</p><h2>The solution</h2><p>WordPress core has this solution solved in a very nice way, using a couple of solutions:</p><h3>Absolute URLs everywhere</h3><p>Whenever WordPress outputs a URL, it&#8217;s always a full, absolute URL. For the domain name part of that it uses the domain you set in the General settings. This is the type of solution everyone should use: the domain name should be in a configuration file, this would allow you to still easily migrate between development environment and live environment by just using different configuration files.</p><h3>Canonical Redirects</h3><p>Whenever WordPress detects that you are on a specific article but are not using the proper &#8220;canonical&#8221; URL, it&#8217;ll try to 301 redirect you to the correct version. For the cases when it doesn&#8217;t detect this (it for instance ignores query parameters added to the URL), there is:</p><h3>The canonical link URL element</h3><p>When you&#8217;re on a single post or page, WordPress puts out a <a\nhref=\"http://yoast.com/canonical-url-links/\">canonical link element</a>, based on what the URL of the current article should be, irregardless of what&#8217;s in your browsers location bar. My <a\nhref=\"http://yoast.com/wordpress/seo/\">WordPress SEO plugin</a> extends this functionality to display canonical link elements just about everywhere within WordPress, and you should do this in your CMS too.</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>Twitter&#8217;s issue could be rather easily resolved, as we&#8217;ve discussed, by using proper absolute URLs everywhere in their code. There are no real good arguments against not doing that. While Twitter is not a direct e-commerce site and might not have the biggest of issues with losing a bit of traffic, I&#8217;ve had issues with relative URLs and relative canonicals at clients that have cost those clients upwards of a hundred thousand euro&#8217;s. The very small gain in web development time, if any, is never, ever, worth that.</p><p>So you should be using absolute URLs at all times, canonical redirects when possible and canonical link elements should ideally be on every page you serve out.

This is undesirable as it means you&#8217;re not using tags to relate your posts together, which is what you should do. We usually tell them to optimize their tags but that&#8217;s easier to say than do. Deleting them is easy, but that&#8217;s not a solution. What you <em>should</em> be doing is merging multiple tags into one, adding more posts to a tag or delete &amp; redirect them to your homepage.</p><p>That&#8217;s not something you want to do manually, as it&#8217;s a lot of work. That&#8217;s why I built a tool called the Term Optimizer. This tool helps you find tags or other taxonomy terms that are used only once, or even less, and allows you to merge them, redirect them, etc.</p><h2>Optimize your WordPress Tags with the Term Optimizer</h2><p>It&#8217;s simple, once you&#8217;ve bought the file, you place it in your WordPress root directory, it needs to have <em>wp- load.php</em> in the same directory. You then open the URL and you&#8217;ll be seeing an interface like this (click for larger version):</p><p><a\nclass=\"thickbox\" href=\"http://cdn.yoast.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/Term-Optimizer-by-Yoast.png\"><img\nclass=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-45853\" title=\"Easy Tag Optimization with Term Optimizer by Yoast\" src=\"http://cdn.yoast.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/Term-Optimizer-by-Yoast-590x533.png\" alt=\"Easy Tag Optimization with Term Optimizer by Yoast\" width=\"580\" height=\"523\" /></a></p><p>By default it&#8217;ll search for all tags that are used less than 4 times. As you can see, there&#8217;s a checkbox before each post. If you check them and use the drop down in the top, you can choose from several actions:</p><p><img\nclass=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-45855\" title=\"With selected tags, do the following: merge, delete &amp; redirect, shows posts with term, search &amp; tag\" src=\"http://cdn.yoast.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/with-selected-do.png\" alt=\"With selected tags, do the following: merge, delete &amp; redirect, shows posts with term, search &amp; tag\" width=\"372\" height=\"133\" /></p><p>If you choose merge and selected, you&#8217;ll be presented with a second screen that allows you to choose the tag you want to merge these tags with. Once that&#8217;s done, if your .htaccess file is writeable, the tool will automatically add the redirect lines to your .htaccess file.</p><p>Pressing delete will do something similar, you&#8217;ll be able to redirect to the homepage, to a category or to a custom URL:</p><p><img\nclass=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-45849\" title=\"Delete &amp; redirect tag\" src=\"http://cdn2.yoast.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/delete-redirect-tag.png\" alt=\"Delete &amp; redirect tag\" width=\"312\" height=\"199\" /></p><p>This allows you to optimize your tags with only a few minutes / hours work, instead of having to get a developer to do all this work for you.</p><h2>Quickly Adding Tags to Posts</h2><p>Sometimes you realize that you should have created a certain tag and it&#8217;s now a lot of work to do that through the interface. With the term optimizer you can do that quite simply (click for larger image):</p><p><a\nclass=\"thickbox\" href=\"http://cdn3.yoast.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/search-tag.png\"><img\nclass=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-45860\" title=\"Search &amp; Tag posts\" src=\"http://cdn.yoast.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/search-tag-590x632.png\" alt=\"Search &amp; Tag posts\" width=\"580\" height=\"621\" /></a></p><h2>Buy this Tool, start Optimizing your Tags Now!</h2><p>We&#8217;ll be making this available to our past website review customers who need it for free, if you&#8217;re not a website review customer but just want to clean up your tags or other terms, you can buy it now:</p><div\nclass=\"aligncenter\"><a\nclass=\"button\" href=\"http://gum.co/vyvF\">Buy Term Optimizer</a></div><p><a\nhref=\"http://yoast.com/optimizing-tags/\">Tag Optimization for WordPress</a> is a post by <a\nrel=\"author\" href=\"http://yoast.com/author/joost/\">Joost de Valk</a> on <a\nhref=\"http://yoast.com\">Yoast - Tweaking Websites</a>.A good WordPress blog needs good hosting, you don\'t want your blog to be slow, or, even worse, down, do you?

It allows site owners to enhance the expanded tweets Twitter creates for their site, much in the same was as  OpenGraph tags give site owners the chance to determine what their posts &amp; pages will look like when shared on Facebook. In fact, Twitter chose to fall back to OpenGraph data when their specific tags aren&#8217;t being used, just as Google+ does.</p><p>A while back Alex posted about <a\nhref=\"http://yoast.com/facebook-open-graph-protocol/\">OpenGraph</a> here and users of my <a\nhref=\"http://yoast.com/wordpress/seo/\">WordPress SEO plugin</a> will have noticed that quite some development went into (and actually still goes into) the OpenGraph settings of that plugin. With this change, that development has been worth while even more. Google+, Facebook and Twitter now all use the basic OpenGraph tags like og:url, <code>og:description</code>, <code>og:title</code> and <code>og:image</code>.</p><p>This means that for a full Twitter Cards implementation, you only really need to add three lines to your site. For instance for every post <a\nhref=\"http://yoast.com/author/michiel/\">Michiel</a> writes on this site, we&#8217;d need to add this:</p><pre class=\"brush: xml; title: ; notranslate\">&lt;meta name=&quot;twitter:card&quot; value=&quot;summary&quot;&gt;\n&lt;meta name=&quot;twitter:site&quot; value=&quot;@yoast&quot;&gt;\n&lt;meta name=&quot;twitter:creator&quot; value=&quot;@michielheijmans&quot;&gt;</pre><p>All the other data would be taken from the OpenGraph metadata that&#8217;s already there. When I noticed this, I realized that the Twitter Card implementation for my SEO plugin would be a breeze; so I went ahead and build it. I&#8217;m currently waiting for access to their beta so I can test it, but the implementation is mostly done. It&#8217;ll add a Twitter contact field to every user&#8217;s profile using the <a\nhref=\"http://yoast.com/user-contact-fields-wordpress/\">method I wrote about a few days ago</a>. Next to that it&#8217;ll allow you to set a site Twitter account and check a box to say you want to include the data, that&#8217;s it. If you want to have a play, the code is already in the WordPress SEO trunk, so you can download it from the <a\nhref=\"http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wordpress-seo/developers/\">developers page</a>.</p><h2>What Twitter Cards mean for OpenGraph</h2><p>As you&#8217;ll understand, Twitter Cards made OpenGraph even more important than it already was. No site on the web should be without the basic OpenGraph meta data anymore. Microsoft recently announced <a\nhref=\"http://blogs.msdn.com/b/ie/archive/2012/05/14/sharing-links-from-ie10-on-windows-8.aspx\">suport for OpenGraph in IE10</a> in Windows 8 as well, which just adds another reason.</p><p>It makes sense too: the OpenGraph protocol is relatively easy yet allows for a bit more than just a meta description and title tag. So go forth and implement OpenGraph!</p><h2>Merge it all into one standard</h2><p>There are some things that obviously need to be worked on though. The fact that Twitter requires the <code>twitter:card</code> meta tag sort of annoys me, as it seems to me they could have just mapped the <code>og:type</code> meta tag for that, which would make implementation even easier. The same goes for the <code>og:url</code> meta tag, Facebook falls back to the <code>rel=canonical</code> element when it&#8217;s there and there is no <code>og:url</code> element, I&#8217;m hoping Twitter will do the same but they haven&#8217;t specified it yet.</p><p>In the <a\nhref=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/opengraph/\">Facebook group</a> that discusses the Open Graph Protocol I already saw <a\nhref=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/opengraph/permalink/447342028623970/\">Tantek Çelik say</a> what I was thinking:</p><blockquote><p>og:&#8230; twitter:&#8230; &#8211; it&#8217;s like vendor prefixes for meta tags! looks like a good opportunity to create a microformat based on commonalities among all this vendor-specific work.</p></blockquote><p>All I can say is: yes!

A while back I got frustrated enough to have a look at how this was actually dealt with in the backend of WordPress, and fix it, so in WordPress 2.9 an API was added as a result of ticket <a\nhref=\"http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/10240\">#10240</a>.</p><p>This change allowed for developers to add user contact fields in a very simple way. The example code below adds Twitter and removes Yahoo IM, and yes, this is all the code that&#8217;s needed to do it:</p><pre class=\"brush: php; title: ; notranslate\">function add_twitter_contactmethod( $contactmethods ) {\n  // Add Twitter\n  if ( !isset( $contactmethods[\'twitter\'] ) )\n    $contactmethods[\'twitter\'] = \'Twitter\';\n\n  // Remove Yahoo IM\n  if ( isset( $contactmethods[\'yim\'] ) )\n    unset( $contactmethods[\'yim\'] );\n\n  return $contactmethods;\n}\nadd_filter( \'user_contactmethods\', \'add_twitter_contactmethod\', 10, 1 );</pre><p>Easy does it, right? Retrieving the user contact field isn&#8217;t much harder either, for example, if you&#8217;re on a singular page, use the following code:</p><pre class=\"brush: php; title: ; notranslate\">if ( is_singular() ) {\n  global $post;\n  $twitter = get_the_author_meta( \'twitter\', $post-&gt;post_author );\n}</pre><p>And there you have it! My <a\nhref=\"http://yoast.com/wordpress/seo/\">WordPress SEO plugin</a> uses this exact method to add a Google+ profile field for users to be used in conjunction with the <a\nhref=\"http://yoast.com/highlighting-wordpress-authors-search/\">author highlighting</a> features of Google. If you&#8217;d want to echo the Google+ user contact field that plugin creates, do the following:</p><pre class=\"brush: php; title: ; notranslate\">if ( is_singular() ) {\n  global $post;\n  the_author_meta( \'googleplus\', $post-&gt;post_author );\n}</pre><p>As you can see this uses <code>the_author_meta</code> instead of <code>get_the_author_meta</code>. The <code>$post</code> global and the <code>$post-&gt;post_author</code> reference would strictly speaking not even be needed as they&#8217;re called from the global otherwise within the function, but this might prevent issues with retrieving the wrong user contact fields.</p><p>That&#8217;s it! Now you can add and remove user contact fields as you wish. You can do this in your theme&#8217;s <em>functions.php</em> or in a plugin, be sure to add the <code>isset</code> code around it to prevent notices though!</p><p><a\nhref=\"http://yoast.com/user-contact-fields-wordpress/\">User Contact Fields in WordPress</a> is a post by <a\nrel=\"author\" href=\"http://yoast.com/author/joost/\">Joost de Valk</a> on <a\nhref=\"http://yoast.com\">Yoast - Tweaking Websites</a>.A good WordPress blog needs good hosting, you don\'t want your blog to be slow, or, even worse, down, do you?

A few weeks back I did a series of bug fix updates and while doing that I noticed there where things that were <em>really</em> bugging me in the plugin. Everybody seemed to focus on the settings and hardly anyone was working with the snippet preview and the page analysis functionality, in my opinion the most important pieces of the plugin. This update will try and gently push you to use that functionality more.</p><p>Next to that, I also did a major overhaul of the two most important settings pages, so let&#8217;s discuss these changes first:</p><h2>The new SEO settings pages</h2><p>The plugin used to have a &#8220;Titles&#8221; and an &#8220;Indexation&#8221; page. That was confusing as the titles page also covered the meta descriptions and had pieces for each (custom) post type and (custom) taxonomy and the Indexation page had other settings for these same post types and taxonomies. So I decided to merge them into one and divide them into tabs for the separate sections.</p><p>These sections now look as follows:</p><p><img\nclass=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-45755\" title=\"Titles Meta settings\" src=\"http://cdn3.yoast.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/Titles-Meta-settings.png\" alt=\"Titles Meta settings\" width=\"580\" height=\"631\" /></p><p>And the section for post types:</p><p><img\nclass=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-45756\" title=\"titles meta settings for post types\" src=\"http://cdn3.yoast.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/titles-metas-post-types.png\" alt=\"titles meta settings for post types\" width=\"580\" height=\"502\" /></p><p>As you can see, they&#8217;re much cleaner. Both post types and taxonomies can now be noindex, followed straight from this interface as well, with the option to override the global setting on a per post or per term (eg. a tag or category) basis.</p><h2>Rel=&#8221;author&#8221;</h2><p>As I mentioned in my previous post about <a\nhref=\"http://yoast.com/push-rel-author-head/\">rel=&#8221;author&#8221; through your head</a>, this feature is now in WordPress SEO 1.2. Simply go to your author profile and fill your Google+ URL and it&#8217;ll be added to each post automagically.</p><h2>Default Settings</h2><p>The WordPress SEO plugin until now always lacked proper default settings. It had them but it didn&#8217;t show them to the user in the titles section and it didn&#8217;t have them for various other sections. While there&#8217;s still more work to do with guiding people to get the right settings, the plugin now sets defaults that should work well for 99% of sites on install.</p><p>This also means the plugin, when freshly installed, will now automatically enable XML Sitemaps and will detect automatically whether force rewrite needs to be enabled or not. That should save me some support headaches.</p><p>But, as I said, those sections aren&#8217;t really that important. This bit is:</p><h2>The Snippet Preview &amp; Focus keyword</h2><p>An enormous amount of bugs have been fixed in the snippet preview and the focus keyword functionality. Most of them are related to non-ascii characters and languages such as Russian and Arabian, but others involve keywords with dollar signs or even simple dashes. &#8220;<a\nhref=\"http://yoast.nl/seo-trainingen/in-company-seo-training/\">In-company SEO training</a>&#8221; for instance will now be properly recognized as a focus keyword.</p><p>The bolding of keywords in the snippet preview has also been fixed for all cases I knew went wrong. If you still have issues, be sure to let me know through the forums; but I fully expect this release to fix most of them.</p><h2>The Page Analysis functionality</h2><p>When I introduced this functionality in May 2011 I thought it was the best thing since sliced bread, but as I said, I couldn&#8217;t get enough people to use it properly. Linkdex, who contributed the original code, always calculated a &#8220;score&#8221; for each page based on that code and I had decided to not use that score. The reason I left it out was simple: I didn&#8217;t want people to optimize for that last percent.</p><p>For this release, I decided it was time to re-think that approach and come up with something better. Now, each post, page or other post type will get a &#8220;score&#8221;, but there are only 4 options:</p><ul><li>bad (red)</li><li>poor (orange)</li><li>ok (yellow)</li><li>good (green)</li></ul><p>They look as follows:</p><p><img\nclass=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-45754\" title=\"Score buttons\" src=\"http://cdn2.yoast.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/score_buttons.png\" alt=\"Score buttons\" width=\"164\" height=\"19\" /></p><p>This score is shown inside the publish box:</p><p><img\nclass=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-45752\" title=\"SEO Score shown inside the publish box\" src=\"http://cdn2.yoast.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/seo-score-publish-box.png\" alt=\"SEO Score shown inside the publish box\" width=\"288\" height=\"96\" /></p><p>But, more importantly, it&#8217;s also shown in the overview of posts and pages, alongside other key SEO info (click for large version):</p><p><a\nclass=\"thickbox\" href=\"http://cdn2.yoast.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/seo-score-pages-overview.png\"><img\nclass=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-45753\" title=\"SEO Score in the pages overview\" src=\"http://cdn3.yoast.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/seo-score-pages-overview-590x231.png\" alt=\"SEO Score in the pages overview\" width=\"580\" height=\"227\" /></a></p><p>As you can see, you can show the SEO score, the focus keyword, the meta description and the title; and you have the ability to sort by the first three of those values. This makes it easy to find posts that don&#8217;t have a focus keyword or have a low SEO score. You can also easily disable those columns that you&#8217;d rather not see. Within the posts overview, there are two colors for posts that aren&#8217;t a score. Grey means the post has no focus keyword and thus no score; blue means the post is set to noindex, so the score doesn&#8217;t matter.</p><h2>Questions and Answers about this release</h2><ul><li><strong>Why is this 1.2 and not 2.0?</strong><br\n/> I&#8217;ve decided my WordPress SEO plugin will follow the same version numbering as WordPress, so each point release is a major version increase. This prevents version number inflation so we don&#8217;t have WordPress SEO 25 in 4-5 years time.</li><li><strong>Will all my settings be saved when I upgrade?</strong><br\n/> Yes. But it won&#8217;t hurt you to go through all your settings and check whether you&#8217;re still doing what&#8217;s best for you.

That version has a bucket load of improvements and some new features, so you might want to test that anyway, it&#8217;ll probably be released early next week.</p><p>If you&#8217;re looking for it in the development version, there are two spots: on each users profile page there&#8217;s a new Google+ contact method:</p><p\nstyle=\"text-align: center;\"><img\nclass=\"size-full wp-image-45693 aligncenter\" title=\"Google Plus for rel=&quot;author&quot;\" src=\"http://cdn.yoast.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/google-plus-profile.png\" alt=\"Google Plus for rel=&quot;author&quot;\" width=\"553\" height=\"285\" /></p><p>When a user fills this out, the link will automatically be added to each post or page he/she publishes.

That would be unrealistic. Why should a constructor learn SEO? He should not. Why should a gardner know all about user experience? He should not. But how about applying some common sense to your website?</p><p>Let&#8217;s go over an imaginary website, top to bottom:</p><h2>Browser</h2><p>Your browser has a couple of spots where your &lt;title&gt; is shown, like in the upper left and on a tab. That means your page title should start with he main subject of the page, not your site name. If it would start with your site name, all tabs would read the same title.</p><p>Next to that, you want your browser to display the website as quick as possible, meaning you should make your website as fast as possible. Sure, browser cache and compression might be way over your head, but how about not using a template with tables and combining your CSS and JavaScript files? Or lowering the number of CSS and JavaScript files by losing all &#8216;extra&#8217; WordPress plugins, assuming your site is in WordPress of course.</p><h2>Header</h2><p>Do your really think putting all these items in your header help visitors or Google:</p><ul><li>RSS, Facebook, Twitter, Google+</li><li>Telephone number</li><li>Additional menu for About Us, Privacy Policy, Contact, Directions, Terms &amp; Conditions</li><li>Subscription form for email newsletter</li><li>Banner for your own or even worse other company&#8217;s products</li><li>Quality Marks</li><li>etc</li></ul><p>And all that in the first 100px of your website. Squeezed together and made to be skipped anyway. That header area should contain only the necessary, all other items should be in a sidebar or footer area. If you want people to call you, list your phone number. Make it large, but no larger than your logo. If you are the best painter in Maine, make that statement in the header. No need for all the other fuzz.</p><p>With your header comes the menu (in most cases). If you would list 30 items in the menu, do you think that would add focus to your website or do you think just using six items would guide your visitor more? Consider creating a submenu and add that structure to your breadcrumbs as well.</p><p>So far I have not mentioned anything strange or difficult to implement, right? It&#8217;s all common sense and you have thought at least 10 times &#8220;I know that already&#8221;. So why are not all websites set up with these basics? Why is there so much crap on the web?</p><h2>Content</h2><p>Your page content should contain at least 300 words. That has a simple reason: would your page be a great source for the topic or keyword you want to rank for when it would only contain 50 words? Is that all there is to say about that keyword? I don&#8217;t believe that, you don&#8217;t believe that and Google does not believe that. There should be a significant amount of content for your page to be considered a great source of information.</p><p>Of course you will write some posts or pages that are much shorter, like your contact page, but do your really want to rank that page? No, not on most websites. Don&#8217;t go crazy over this on pages like that, that&#8217;s not worth the effort. Get them on your site with other pages and guide them to your contact form.</p><p>An easy way to do that is by using <a\ntitle=\"Where do you want me to click?\" href=\"http://yoast.com/call-to-action/\">a call-to-action</a>. Make that call-to-action stand out by using colors that are not overused in your design or use a much larger font. Surround the call-to-action with enough whitespace. If you are adding your fourth call-to-action, please realize that that again is killing all focus on the website. Stick to one and let the content do the rest.</p><p>Focus in your content can be achieved by adding subheadings to your text that should be structured in (again) a logical matter, pretty much the same way you should set up a Word document:</p><ul><li>H1<ul\nstyle=\"margin-bottom: 0;\"><li>H2<ul\nstyle=\"margin-bottom: 0;\"><li>H3</li><li>H3</li></ul></li><li>H2</li></ul></li></ul><p>That also means one H1 per page, being the site name on the homepage and the page title on the other pages.</p><p>I think we all agree nowadays that reading on a computer screen is not as pleasant as reading text on paper. But we should make things as convenient as possible: make short sentences and even more important, create short paragraphs. I&#8217;d like to create paragraphs that are four to eight lines long and I hope this is a nice read ;)</p><p>In these paragraphs you should link to your own pages as well as to other websites. The great thing about these links to your own pages is that these links are really valuable as they are surrounded with relevant, related content. Next to that, you can easily use your keywords of choice in the anchor text. Unfortunately most people seem to think that these links should only go to other websites. A regrettable misunderstanding.</p><h2>Sharing</h2><p>If you write great content.. Let me rephrase that: <strong>provided</strong> you write great content, people will be more than willing to tell others about your piece. Of course you should add social sharing buttons below the content. These buttons should not be styled in some fashionable way, but should look like the commonly used share buttons &#8211; see below this post ;) &#8211; for better recognition as sharing buttons.</p><p>I&#8217;d use Facebook, Twitter, Share-by-email and Google+ for all websites, Linkedin for business news / economy related websites and Pinterest only when you have that amazing image in the post that people might want to share. Do not list a share option, just because people you know are using it, but only use those sharing options you think are relevant for your website.</p><p>The fashionable buttons can be used for subscription options, like links to your Facebook profile or your Youtube channel. In most cases, the square icons are used for this, or the round icons you find on yoast.com.</p><h2>Footer</h2><p>This is not a great footer:</p><blockquote><p>© SomewebsiteImade.com. All rights reserved. Reproduction of this content only after written permission.</p></blockquote><p>First: really? Share buttons <em>and</em> telling people they should not use your content on other websites? We actually encountered this in one of the <a\ntitle=\"Website Review\" href=\"http://yoast.com/hire-me/website-review/\">websites we have reviewed</a>.</p><p>Next to that, I think the entire footer should be used for extra contact information (or a small form) and other information that you really want to list on your website like a small link list, perhaps some recent news items and a small category list (max 8 items or so). Not sure about this, but why not throw in some social profiles as well..</p><p>What I really dislike is a footer that has one million links in it. That reduces the value of all other links and all focus on the page.</p><p>So, in conclusion, I think you should not so much focus on hearsay about SEO, but think about what seems logical and makes the most sense. Only when your website makes common sense to you, you should go look for someone that can help you with the not so logical Search Engine and Usability optimization issues ;)</p><h3>Any additions?</h3><p>Common sense is not as easy as it looks for a lot of people.

We get quite a lot response on that, with people being unclear how to do that. &#8220;Where should I put that content?&#8221; or &#8220;How long should that content be?&#8221; or the one I dislike the most: &#8220;I don&#8217;t need that&#8221;.</p><h2>The main goal of introductory content</h2><p>I can not emphasize this enough. Introductory content is meant for your most valued visitors: us people and Google. Introductory content helps those visitors to grasp the leitmotif of your website. It also tells the visitor why you are the source to turn to, whether or not in combination with the title of your website.</p><p>There are two main ways to list that introductory content:</p><h3>The right slogan or tagline as introductory content</h3><p><img\nclass=\"alignright size-full wp-image-45640\" title=\"Chicago Tribune logo\" src=\"http://cdn.yoast.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/chicago-tribune.png\" alt=\"Chicago Tribune logo: notice the caption\" width=\"318\" height=\"79\" />If only things where always this simple. <a\ntitle=\"Chicago Tribune\" href=\"http://www.chicagotribune.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Chicago Tribune</a> has a small caption below the logo that tells all: We are a Chicago based news provider bringing you all the latest news and we are doing this for such a long time you can consider us a trustworthy source.</p><p>The Chicago Tribune can do that this way and get away with it. But if you are a local news agency that brings mainly local news, you might need a different approach. Just the tagline might not be enough.</p><p>Suppose you are running the website of that more local newsletter, for instance the <a\ntitle=\"Local newspaper for Stowe\" href=\"http://www.stowetoday.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Stowe Today</a>. I really love these kind of websites, since they seem to be made with more care and passion than most websites. But it totally lacks introductory content. You have to know Stowe Today to know what the website is about.</p><p>A huge number of inbound links is telling Google what the Chicago Tribune is about, but I can&#8217;t imagine Stowe Today benefitting from such a number of in-links. The website will have to tell Google itself what it is about. It&#8217;s not.</p><p>The website starts off with a lot of (local) banner ads and some featured articles, but nowhere on that page it tells me &#8216;bringing you local news from Stowe, including human interest stories, upcoming events and more&#8217;. If I would not have known better, it might also have been a blog from a very enthusiastic local student, earning an extra buck this way. I also checked the <a\ntitle=\"About Sowe Today\" href=\"http://www.stowetoday.com/site/about/\">About</a>. page of the website, but that only refers to other publications.</p><h3>Adding a few paragraphs as an introduction</h3><p>Most news websites or webshops think they have no space for a few extra paragraphs of introductory content. The website should start with either news or products. I call bullsh*t on that.</p><p>I&#8217;m not a big fan of the somewhat sneaky way the <a\ntitle=\"Hidden introductory content\" href=\"http://www.hypedc.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">online sneakershop Hypedc.com</a> did this:</p><p><img\nclass=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-45641\" title=\"Hypedc.com source code\" src=\"http://cdn.yoast.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/hypedccom-590x215.png\" alt=\"Hypedc.com source code\" width=\"580\" height=\"211\" /><br\n/> As you can see, the introduction is there, but is not shown on the page itself. You are serving that intro to Google, but not to your customers. Why not!?</p><p>But that is just one way. I&#8217;m a much bigger fan of the way <a\ntitle=\"WP Types introductory content\" href=\"http://wp-types.com/\">WP-Types.com</a> is doing this, for instance:</p><p><img\nclass=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-45642\" title=\"wp-types\" src=\"http://cdn2.yoast.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/wp-types.png\" alt=\"WP-Types\" width=\"556\" height=\"288\" /></p><p>&#8220;But they just have a couple of products&#8221;. I hear you, that&#8217;s right. But how about the way <a\ntitle=\"Large intro for SurfStitch\" href=\"http://www.surfstitch.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">SurfStitch</a> is doing this? That&#8217;s actually quite common for (Magento) webshops.

Because there has been quite some news about Google&#8217;s Penguin update and before that its Panda update, people are blaming those. In our perspective, whether you&#8217;re blaming Penguin, Panda or another update from Google isn&#8217;t really that interesting if you&#8217;re not an SEO. What matters most is: you&#8217;ve lost traffic, how are you going to get it back?</p><h2>Why you&#8217;d want to know whether the Penguin update caused it</h2><p>The idea is that if you know which update caused your traffic to drop and you know what that update targeted, you only have to fix that specific issue and your rankings will be magically restored. The reality is that it&#8217;s <em>really </em>not that black and white. Quite often now people blame one update, but if we look at the SearchMetrics stats for their domain, they&#8217;ve had a gradual decline over the last few months with a bigger decline in recent weeks. If we based our actions solely on what Penguin update targeted (and that&#8217;s not even really clear yet within the SEO community) we might be missing other issues.</p><p>There were other updates that didn&#8217;t get named by Google in the same way but had a <em>huge</em> impact in some countries. We&#8217;ve seen sites with over-optimized anchor text being hit from the beginning of the year already, but suddenly people now attribute that to Penguin. The end result for you as a site owner: it doesn&#8217;t matter.</p><p>You need to fix <em>all</em> your issues, not just the ones that this specific update &#8220;targets&#8221;.</p><h2>How to get &#8220;your&#8221; traffic back</h2><p>First of all, it&#8217;s not your traffic. It&#8217;s Google&#8217;s traffic. Being mad at Google, or anyone else for that matter, won&#8217;t help you one bit, it&#8217;s Google&#8217;s traffic and they can do what they want with it. So to regain the traffic your website was getting from Google, you need to play by their rules and in all honesty: those rules haven&#8217;t changed all that much over the last 10 years. The only thing that&#8217;s happening is that all the ways people found of bending those rules are slowly breaking.</p><p>Don&#8217;t try and play a game with Google if you don&#8217;t understand what you&#8217;re doing. There are dozens of great blackhats out there whom I respect, but that&#8217;s because they do their own research and they don&#8217;t start complaining publicly when Google catches them. If you have to read about and apply other people&#8217;s tricks, you&#8217;re probably not going to win. As the old saying goes: if you can&#8217;t stand the heat, stay out of the kitchen.</p><p>So how <em>do</em> you get your traffic back? By getting your site re-aligned with Google&#8217;s values. If you&#8217;ve lost in the Panda update or Penguin update and now recently lost a lot of traffic <em>again</em>, Google is sending you a message: your website doesn&#8217;t fit our idea of quality. Fix that. Don&#8217;t try to remove the one or two links that you think might have hurt you.</p><p>Now of course, you&#8217;re more than welcome to <a\ntitle=\"Website Review\" href=\"http://yoast.com/hire-me/website-review/\">order a website review</a> and get our opinion, but please don&#8217;t expect us to come up with a silver bullet.

He tweeted it, at first, with a <a\nhref=\"http://bo.lt\">bo.lt</a> link. Bo.lt is a sharing service that allows you to basically make a copy of a page and add some notes or even some changes to the page. The idea is nice, as a webmaster though, I hate it. Let me explain why.</p><p>You see, bo.lt makes a <em>copy</em> of the page at the moment it&#8217;s prepared for sharing, they say they do that because of speed. As Avinash tweets a lot, he probably made that copy a couple of hours before he shared it. This wouldn&#8217;t be so much of an issue if I hadn&#8217;t added stuff to the page in the mean time and fixed a lot of typo&#8217;s. Everyone who&#8217;d use Avinash&#8217;s link wouldn&#8217;t see those changes. And bo.lt decided that for me, without asking me anything, or even worse, giving me the option to opt-out.</p><h2>SEO Impact</h2><p>Surely those bo.lt guys are at least trying to give the rankings for those pages people share through its service their links back? No. They don&#8217;t. Well, not unless you&#8217;re not already adding <code>rel=\"canonical\"</code> elements to your site yourself. Each user has its own subdomain. Avinash&#8217;s subdomain is zqi.bo.lt. As you can <a\nhref=\"http://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Abo.lt+yoast&amp;pws=0\">see for yourself</a>, quite a few of his shared pages are indexed by Google. That shouldn&#8217;t be possible. Bo.lt should add a canonical back to the original page if there isn&#8217;t one in the source already.</p><h2>No Analytics</h2><p>They claim a webmaster gets all his normal stuff, ads and analytics etc. Except that for both Clicky and Google Analytics there are no views measured for that bo.lt link, because Clicky refuses pageviews from other domains and I&#8217;ve filtered those out of Google Analytics to prevent others from rendering my analytics useless (yes, people do try that). So, &#8220;my&#8221; visitors don&#8217;t get the changes I made to the copy, making me look stupid and I can&#8217;t track which visitors those were and where they came from&#8230; At this point, I want out.</p><h2>Opt Out</h2><p>I&#8217;ve gone through their documentation, both normal and for developers, and there simply is no documented way to opt-out. So I decided to dive a bit deeper and figure out which user-agent bo.lt uses. It turns out that they actually <em>do</em> have a <a\nhref=\"http://bo.lt/ua\">page about their user-agent</a>. The next step would normally be simple: add a line to your robots.txt blocking bo.lt. Unfortunately, in my tests, bo.lt never actually retrieved the robots.txt file so they&#8217;re not adhering to the robots.txt protocol. They <em>really</em> should. They&#8217;re taking my content, they&#8217;re not asking for permission and they&#8217;re not allowing me to opt-out. Someone could sue them over that. I&#8217;m just going to request, through this blog post:</p><p><strong>Bo.lt, please add an option to opt my sites out of your service.</strong></p><p>Also, in my opinion, if you&#8217;re using bo.lt, you should probably start considering alternatives.</p><p>Disclaimer: please be aware that I like Avinash a lot and don&#8217;t blame <em>him</em> for anything. He&#8217;s a great guy and an inspiration to a lot of us in the online marketing industry. It&#8217;s the bo.lt service I dislike and I think that after reading this he will switch to something else as well.</p><h2>A &#8220;hard&#8221; out</h2><p>I figured out a &#8220;hard&#8221; way to get out of bo.lt doing its thing, add the following to your <em>.htaccess</em> file:</p><pre class=\"brush: plain; title: ; notranslate\">RewriteBase /\nRewriteEngine on\nRewriteCond %{HTTP_USER_AGENT} bo.lt/ua\nRewriteRule . - [F,L]</pre><p>This will block bo.lt, giving it a &#8220;forbidden&#8221; page.</p><p><a\nhref=\"http://yoast.com/dislike-bolt/\">Why I dislike Bo.lt</a> is a post by <a\nrel=\"author\" href=\"http://yoast.com/author/joost/\">Joost de Valk</a> on <a\nhref=\"http://yoast.com\">Yoast - Tweaking Websites</a>.A good WordPress blog needs good hosting, you don\'t want your blog to be slow, or, even worse, down, do you?

I then started adding more stats on my own.</p><p>I asked <a\nhref=\"http://www.experian.com/hitwise/index.html\">Experian Hitwise</a> to give me some stats about visits to WordPress.org, Drupal.org and Joomla.org in the UK and US, which they did (thanks!). <a\nhref=\"https://www.odesk.com/trends/WordPress\">oDesk</a> and <a\nhref=\"http://www.freelancer.com/hire/Wordpress\">Freelancer.com</a> have some great WordPress stats pages and of course there&#8217;s a bit of info <a\nhref=\"http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/\">on WordPress</a>.org itself. So, with all of that and some I&#8217;m probably forgetting, <a\nhref=\"http://www.designbysoap.co.uk/design/infographic-design/?utm_source=yoast&amp;utm_medium=post&amp;utm_campaign=wordpress-stats\">Design by Soap</a> made the following infographic for me, I hope you like it, if you do, please share it!

Other SEO&#8217;s don&#8217;t care about Google&#8217;s guidelines as much and do what&#8217;s called &#8220;black hat SEO&#8221;. Far too often though, black hat SEO is confused with the hacking of sites and the use of other tactics not outside the laws of Google but the laws of our lands. I think it&#8217;s time for me to explain where I stand in this.</p><h2>My background</h2><p>As a former Theology student and as someone raised in the Christian tradition, I have a fairly specific (and in some eyes: stringent) set of ethics. I don&#8217;t work on gambling or porn related sites because of that. I&#8217;m aware that others have different opinions on this and I don&#8217;t judge others when they have other ethics with regards to their work. To each his own. Sometimes though, I draw the line. Among my friends are some of the world&#8217;s best black hat SEO&#8217;s. These are also guys that will <em>never</em> break a law or willfully hurt other people to get their rankings, they just game Google&#8217;s algorithms. I know <a\nhref=\"http://mattcutts.com/blog/\">Matt</a> knows at least some of them and there&#8217;s even a form of &#8220;honor&#8221; among them: he seems to appreciate their ability to outwit their algorithm. Unfortunately not everyone in the SEO &#8220;community&#8221; is that clean: some people <em>are </em>willing to break laws or hurt other people. After the last SES conference in Amsterdam, which I arranged the speakers for, one of the speakers (not the keynote :) ) admitted to me he wouldn&#8217;t mind teaching other people how to hack sites or how to build trojans to gain links. I was too startled to give a proper response but decided later that day that I would never allow him back on a conference I arranged speakers for.</p><h2>Spammy Link Building in the Netherlands</h2><p>The last few days there&#8217;s been <a\nhref=\"http://www.molblog.nl/bericht/douwe-egberts-kpn-pon-en-randstad-betrokken-bij-icomment-spam-i/\">an outcry</a> in the Netherlands over several companies using comment spam and forum spam as a method of gaining links. They&#8217;d been caught creating fake profiles on all sort of sites and pretending to interact while really only inserting their links. I had to laugh a bit, as would most of my UK, American and German friends, as that&#8217;s <em>so</em> common outside of the Netherlands nobody would be surprised to see that anymore. There was <a\nhref=\"http://www.molblog.nl/bericht/de-buzzmollen-van-groupon/\">one specific case</a> though that &#8220;hurt&#8221; more than others (which was by another company by the way). Someone had willfully created an account on a forum for MS (multiple sclerosis) patients, claiming to be a patient, while was spamming links there to health related offers. That&#8217;s so low that it hurts.</p><h2>Outing Non-ethical SEO practices: immoral?</h2><p>Recently Joe Hall, whom I respect a lot, did a post saying <a\nhref=\"http://joehall.me/seo-outing-is-immoral/29/\">SEO &#8220;outing&#8221; is immoral</a>. He mentions that while the outed practices themselves might be non-ethical, those people have families too, etc. Basically: people lose their jobs because of it. That&#8217;s true. And that&#8217;s sad. Especially as most of those people will not know what hit them. I will counter that though: those companies have grown by using their unethical methods, costing other people their jobs in other companies. This is a zero-sum game in most cases. Google doesn&#8217;t tell people what to buy, it helps them find <em>where</em> they can buy it. Keep this in your mind at all times: search doesn&#8217;t create demand, it merely funnels it. I refuse to let people who use unethical SEO methods &#8220;win&#8221; because they support families, simply because their more ethical competitors support families too. I recently <a\nhref=\"http://yoast.com/godaddy-link-building/\">outed GoDaddy</a> over using spammy link building techniques and got a lot of flack for that from other people in the industry. Some seem to think that it&#8217;s all of &#8220;us&#8221; (SEO&#8217;s) against &#8220;them&#8221; (Google). I wholeheartedly disagree. GoDaddy was using its paying customers to strengthen their own SEO without consulting them, in fact, they were specifically hiding what they were doing in their editor. I don&#8217;t mind them &#8220;playing&#8221; Google&#8217;s algorithms. I mind them abusing their customers websites without their consent. The only way of making that stop is to ask Google to remove the value that abuse has. In the same way I loathe WordPress plugin developers who add links to their users sites without consent. I will <em>not</em> &#8221;out&#8221; people for buying high quality, relevant links from high quality websites related to their own topic, I have less issues outing people who hack into my website to gain a few links. This happens more often than I dare to admit.</p><h2>Policing the web</h2><p>Joe goes further and says:</p><blockquote><p>&#8220;If your paycheck doesn’t say “Google” on it, it’s not your job to police the web.&#8221;</p></blockquote><p>My paycheck doesn&#8217;t say Google. I&#8217;m not policing the web. Neither is Google. Google is trying to maintain a set of rules <em>within its own index</em>. It has all the rights in the world to do that. My paycheck doesn&#8217;t say &#8220;WordPress&#8221; either, yet I help develop that project because we all benefit. There <em>really</em> is such a thing as &#8220;the common good&#8221;. That&#8217;s entirely different from outing every SEO I find that does something outside of Google&#8217;s guidelines, I&#8217;m smart enough to create my own set of ethics. I hope you are too. I for one intend to help them battle unethical SEO&#8217;s because I think we all benefit from that.</p><p><a\nhref=\"http://yoast.com/ethics-seo/\">The ethics of SEO</a> is a post by <a\nrel=\"author\" href=\"http://yoast.com/author/joost/\">Joost de Valk</a> on <a\nhref=\"http://yoast.com\">Yoast - Tweaking Websites</a>.A good WordPress blog needs good hosting, you don\'t want your blog to be slow, or, even worse, down, do you?

Your product can be the greatest thing on earth or the dullest office supply ever, both can be sold online when your visitor knows you are the best supplier for that product or service.</p><p>We often advise on how to gain trust in our <a\ntitle=\"Website Review\" href=\"http://yoast.com/hire-me/website-review/\">website reviews</a>, and I&#8217;ve compiled a list of some of the advice we&#8217;ve given over time. Of course, trust can be earned in more ways than this, but we&#8217;ll give you these seven to start with.</p><h2>1. Use clear and normal language</h2><p>This is an often overseen issue that causes a lot of misgrief with your visitors. You should speak their language, not drown them in a sea of technical specs you don&#8217;t even understand yourself. Use a clear and direct style of writing. Keep your audience in mind. Do not focus on telling them what you want to tell them, focus on providing as many arguments as possible why their quality of life improves after buying that specific product.</p><h2>2. Testimonials</h2><p>Do not brag about your products yourself. If your products or services are really that good, I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;ll find someone else that can do the bragging for you. Make sure your visitor understand that the testimonial is written by an actual customer, by listing at least name and company and if the customer agrees, even a picture of him. Video seems to be the next big thing in testimonials, by the way. In my opinion, that video testimonial should be accompanied by a written excerpt:</p><div\nid=\"attachment_45461\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\" style=\"width: 590px\"><a\nhref=\"http://cdn.yoast.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/testimonials-cloversites.com_.png\"><img\nclass=\"size-large wp-image-45461\" title=\"Testimonials as seen on cloversites.com\" src=\"http://cdn2.yoast.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/testimonials-cloversites.com_-590x472.png\" alt=\"Testimonials as seen on cloversites.com\" width=\"580\" height=\"464\" /></a><p\nclass=\"wp-caption-text\">Testimonials as seen on cloversites.com</p></div><h2>3. Verified signs</h2><p>Everyone can create a verified sign, so don&#8217;t let those verified signs fool you. But the majority of your visitors actually believe that you are the &#8216;Most appreciated hairdresser of Mississippi&#8217; or the &#8216;Best Plummer 2006&#8242;. Man, I hate those signs. But when the signs are from well-known companies, they really do add value to a webshop:</p><div\nid=\"attachment_45459\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\" style=\"width: 590px\"><a\nhref=\"http://cdn2.yoast.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/verified-signs-dx.com_.png\"><img\nclass=\"size-large wp-image-45459\" title=\"&quot;Verified&quot; signs\" src=\"http://cdn2.yoast.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/verified-signs-dx.com_-590x76.png\" alt=\"&quot;Verified&quot; signs\" width=\"580\" height=\"74\" /></a><p\nclass=\"wp-caption-text\">&quot;Verified&quot; signs</p></div><p>By investing in the guidelines of the right verification companies  the webshop shows that it has been keeping the customer in mind when setting up the website.</p><h2>4. Pictures</h2><p>If you recognize the woman on this picture, please call the following toll-free number&#8230;:</p><p><a\nhref=\"http://cdn3.yoast.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/picture-stock.png\"><img\nclass=\"alignright size-large wp-image-45460\" title=\"Stock photography\" src=\"http://cdn2.yoast.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/picture-stock-590x314.png\" alt=\"Stock photography\" width=\"580\" height=\"308\" /></a></p><p>You can do better than that stock photo. Listing actual pictures of yourself and/or your employees pushes conversion due to recognition and identification.</p><h2>5. List your physical address</h2><p>This one is really simple: people want to know there is a place to go to in case of problems (if any). Having an actual store next to your webshop works even better, especially if a lot of your customers are relatively local.</p><p>In the Netherlands <a\nhref=\"http://digitalstreet.nl/\">digitalstreet.nl</a> made this concept into a huge success, even though they&#8217;re located in the south-west of the Netherlands (quite near to where we are), people come from all over the Netherlands because they&#8217;d rather buy the product in the store. There are more stories like that, but even if you don&#8217;t want to do that, just listing your address on check-out pages increases trust a lot.</p><h2>6. What happens after check-out?</h2><p>There&#8217;s this hesitation in almost all buying decisions: right before you click the Pay Now button. What&#8217;s going to happen next? Am I charged for taxes, import, anything else? Can I select a wrapping paper? Explain what happens after clicking that button. That way the customer is included in your ordering process and there are absolutely no suprises. That can be done with just a few short lines of text:</p><p><a\nhref=\"http://cdn2.yoast.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/checkout-bloomingdales.com_.png\"><img\nclass=\"alignright size-large wp-image-45458\" title=\"checkout message on bloomingdales.com\" src=\"http://cdn.yoast.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/checkout-bloomingdales.com_-590x244.png\" alt=\"checkout message on bloomingdales.com\" width=\"580\" height=\"239\" /></a></p><h2>7. Show you care about more than making money</h2><p>The most important thing is that your website has to reflect your believe in the product or service you provide. Just a list of products is not enough. Also tell your customer about your company, your main values or mission statement. I really love the 1% for the Planet from Yvon Chouinard (Patagonia) and Craig Mathews (Blue Ribbon Flies) <a\nhref=\"http://www.onepercentfortheplanet.org/\">http://www.onepercentfortheplanet.org</a>. Next to showing that you are involved, it also creates a huge sympathy and trust factor.</p><h2>We&#8217;d love to hear your tips!</h2><p>If you are selling products or services on your website, you must have thought about this subject. I&#8217;m curious: What have you done on your website to increase trust? What are you going to do?</p><p><a\nhref=\"http://yoast.com/7-ways-to-increase-sales-by-creating-trust/\">7 ways to Increase Sales by creating Trust</a> is a post by <a\nrel=\"author\" href=\"http://yoast.com/author/michiel/\">Michiel Heijmans</a> on <a\nhref=\"http://yoast.com\">Yoast - Tweaking Websites</a>.A good WordPress blog needs good hosting, you don\'t want your blog to be slow, or, even worse, down, do you?

(Disclaimer: Rant ahead!)<br /><br />Essentially what is happening here is that MIT\'s IT department is preforming the extremely evil and nefarious act of running Snort on a SPAN port and gathering Netflow data. (If you didn\'t detect the sarcasm in that statement, please insert it now.)<br /><br />Before I go any farther I realize that the the main point here is that there was no \"policy\" regarding this practice. Though the tone of the article seems to be trying to infer some alternative motive on the part of the MIT IS&amp;T department.<br /><br />First let me address Netflows. Netflows are nothing more than a method to watch how much data is going through an interface. Netflows do <span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">not</span> spy on users. I\'d say more but that\'s about all Netflows do! The picture is an example of a Netflow capture.<br /><br />Snort on the other hand does grab the packets from the network for analysis. The easiest way to set this up is with a span port or in my world a monitor port (Procurve dork). Span ports create a copy of all the data passing through a switch and recreate it on the port designated as the span port. This is the easiest way to setup a IDS because it allows you to set it up on a network without making the IDS box a router or proxy. It can sample the network data off to the side and leave the rest of the network alone.<br /><br />Snort does create a copy of the data going over a network but for a short time. It\'s called an intrusion detection system because that\'s what it does. It does not monitor people in the tone the article is written in.<br /><br />I love this quote:<br /><blockquote>\"Undergraduate Association President Noah S. Jessop ’09 said he was surprised that IS&amp;T was collecting this information without notice. “It is not the kind of thing I would expect from MIT, and it is definitely not the kind of thing that I would expect to hear long after the fact.”\"</blockquote>Mr. Jessop probably didn\'t hear about it until long after the fact because this level of monitoring is common security practice in most organization on the Earth with an IT department. Honestly I\'d be very surprised to find out that this is all a school the size of MIT is doing to watch for hackers and compromised systems on their network.<br /><br />Before I get a bunch of hate mail for this I should say that I do agree that policies are important and that MIT should have a policy that dictates how long the snort logs are kept. Policies protect organizations and departments from internal deputes (supposed to anyway) and they provide a set of guidelines to follow which helps streamline processes.<br /><blockquote>\"Professor Harold Abelson, who teaches 6.805 “Ethics and the Law on the Electronic Frontier,” found it troubling that these logs were being collected without public knowledge. “It’s a violation of fair information practices to be keeping logs that people don’t know about … If they’re collecting logs, they have to inform people that it’s there. If they’re collecting logs, there has to be a policy on how those logs are used or not used.”\"</blockquote>Professor Abelson needs to realize that if you connect a computer to a network that you should assume that there are connection logs begin kept. Most off the shelf home routers keep minimal connection logs. Connection logs are kept for many reasons, most basic of which is simple troubleshooting. Companies/Universities are under no obligation to inform user about such practices, especially about something that is a common security practice.<br /><br />Also:<br /><p></p><blockquote><p>\"About the logs, Jessop said “It’s egregious to implement measures on the network that could be used to circumvent user privacy without both policies and procedures in place and some means for the users to understand what the implications to them might be,” Jessop said.</p><p>“If you told me this was Comcast, I wouldn’t have been quite as surprised,” he said.\"</p></blockquote><p></p>My point is, in short, if you connect to a network that you do not control, always assume some level of logging/monitoring is being done as a matter of common sense. If you are really concerned about people spying (which you should be on public networks), encrypt your data! I do agree with Jessop that people should understand the implications of running their computers on public networks.

The mailbox was fine and worked in Outlook, but Outlook Web Access gave the error below. The fix I found out is really simple, just reapply the 2008 attributes.

A colleague of mine pointed me toward this annoyingly easy fix. Vista has something called network auto-tuning. Essentially it\'s Vista trying to be helpful with your network connection and other network devices not know how to handle what vista is doing. (Thats my interpretation of the cause, if that doesn\'t sound right to you please feel free to correct me).<br /><br />To disable auto-tuning open an administrator command prompt and type:<br /><br /><blockquote>NETSH INTERFACE TCP SET global autotuninglevel=disabled<br /><br /></blockquote>Then reboot. You can also try setting it to restricted first as well to see if that will help. The restricted setting will not completely disable it but may help with some network devices.<br /><br />I can\'t guarantee that this will completely fix the issue, but for me it\'s done wonders. Now my Vista machine is almost as fast as my XP box.<br /><br />There are some other setting for the auto-tuning level. <a href=\"http://blogs.msdn.com/wndp/archive/2007/07/05/receive-window-auto-tuning-on-vista.aspx\">This article</a> on the Windows Core Networking blog has a very good explanation of some of them.

So I needed a way to migrate only the staff to the new exchange 2007 server. Well all the staff are members of the sonicwall - staff group.

The script also has problems with people who have changed their names, should be easy to fix, or at least work around.

I also have been learning powershell so I decided to use that to write to MSSQL.<br /><br />Right now I have a simple flat database that I made in SQL 2005 Express with the following columns:<br />Name&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Type<br />Entry&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; int<br />ServerName&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; nvarchar(50)<br />DB&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; nvarchar(50)<br />SizeinGB&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; nvarchar(50)<br />Users&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; nvarchar(50)<br />DateStamp&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; nvarchar(50)<br /><br />Like I said simple.

To give a little background. We migrated from Exchange 2007 to Exchange 2010 mid to late last year. When we finally got the builk of our users on Exchange 2010, the super powerfull 12 core BL465 G6 servers with 32 GB of ram, that we were using for mailbox server (with FC connected storage) were dog slow. We spent a lot of time on the phone with Microsoft support and no progress was made for a long time. We were seeing VERY high storport latency and lots of outlook clients were having connectivity issues.</p><p>Fast forward to a week and a half ago. I was on the phone with MS support and the last thing they asked me to do was make sure the power plan was set to High Performance. I dismissed the recommendation at first not realzing the improvements MS had made in 2008 R2 in terms of power management. For those wondering the Balanced power plan does affect the processor clock speed on Server 2008 and 2008 R2!</p><p>Later that weekend I talked to a friend who told me about a similar issue that can happen to SQL servers running on Server 2008 and 2008 R2. He then informed me about a BIOS setting that they had to tweek. (thanks Ed). Since SQL and Exchange have similar behavior in terms of resource usage, I researched the issue from the point of view of SQL and sure enough there is a ton of information out there regarding SQL and processor scaling cause by power saving features.</p><p>Per my friends recomendation I grabbed a copy of CPU-Z and tried it on Exchange. Sure enough the processors on the Exchange servers we dynamically clocking down to 400MHZ with a 2x mutiplier. Way slower than a Opteron should be showing.</p><p>After more digging i found out that the Proliant G6 and G7 models have a feature enabled, in the BIOS, by default called HP Dynamic Power Savings Mode, which is not OS aware. It turns out that fixed it. Here are the BIOS settings I set on the exchange servers to get the best performance.</p><p>(FYI: The below settings turn off all power saving features of the servers, and set the processor to run at max performance.

I also didn\'t know that ilo makes some of this information available without authentication. For example, point a web browser at an ILO interface using the following:<br /><br /><blockquote>http://ilo-address/xmldata?item=All</blockquote>You will get an XML document with the server\'s serial number, model, rack location (if set), and blade enclosure name, to name a few of the cooler things. To access that information using powershell you need to create a new xmldocument object.<br /><br /><blockquote>$doc = New-Object System.Xml.XmlDocument<br />$doc.Load(\"http://ilo-address/xmldata?item=All\")</blockquote>You can then list out the properties with the following:<br /><blockquote>$doc.RIMP.INFRA2.BLADES.BLADE | get-member</blockquote>Although viewing the xml in a web browser shows the XML in a little more friendly way. you can then display the information using a simple write-host.<br /><br /><blockquote>Write-Host $doc.RIMP.HSI.SPN #gets server type<br />Write-Host $doc.RIMP.HSI.SBSN #gets serial<br />Write-Host $doc.RIMP.BLADESYSTEM.BAY #chassis slot<br />Write-Host $doc.RIMP.BLADESYSTEM.MANAGER.RACK #Rack location</blockquote>All together it would look like this.<br /><br /><blockquote>$doc = New-Object System.Xml.XmlDocument<br />$doc.Load(\"http://ilo-address/xmldata?item=All\")<br /><br />Write-Host $doc.RIMP.HSI.SPN #gets server type<br />Write-Host $doc.RIMP.HSI.SBSN #gets serial<br />Write-Host $doc.RIMP.BLADESYSTEM.BAY #chassis slot<br />Write-Host $doc.RIMP.BLADESYSTEM.MANAGER.RACK #Rack location</blockquote>The one thing I can\'t figure out is how to get the actual server name. If anyone has an idea on how to do that please leave a comment.<br /><br />Alternatively you can do the same thing with the HP onboard adminstrator on C series chassis.<br /><blockquote>$doc = New-Object System.Xml.XmlDocument<br />$doc.Load(\"http://oba-address/xmldata?item=All\")<br /><br />$doc.RIMP.INFRA2.BLADES.BLADE | FT -autosize</blockquote>The above returns usefull things like the ILO IP for all blades in the chassis, blade serial numbers, and hardware models.<br /><br />There is a lot more information in the XML configs.

I was trying to setup a Windows 2008 R2 cluster for use as a SQL 2008 R2 cluster. However the SAN storage I was given was created as dynamic partitions which isn\'t natively supported in Windows clustering, but is supported using Veritas Storage Foundation.\n\nNo matter how many times you try and add a new disk to the cluster it will tell you, \"No disks suitable for cluster disks were found. For diagnostic information about disks available to the cluster, use the Validate a Configuration Wizard to run Storage tests.\" But the validation test won\'t show usable storage.\n\nFirst you need to make sure that the Cluster Option for Microsoft Cluster Service (MSCS)/Failover Cluster is installed in Veritas Storage Foundation. You will need a license for this feature otherwise the check box will be greyed out. The feature can be added using Programs and Features in the control panel.\n\nTo actually make the cluster see the storage you first need to create an Empty Service or Application in the Failover Cluster Manager.\n<ol>\n	<li>Right click on Services and application</li>\n	<li>Select more actions</li>\n	<li>Select Create Empty Service or Application</li>\n</ol>\nNext you must add a Volume Manager Disk Group to the empty application you just created.\n<ol>\n	<li>Right click on the clustered application you just created.</li>\n	<li>Select Add a resource</li>\n	<li>Select More Resources</li>\n	<li>select 9 - Add Volume Manager Disk Group</li>\n</ol>\nNow you have to tell the new disk group you created what the name of the disk group is in Veritas.\n<ol>\n	<li>Right click on the disk group you just created and select properties.</li>\n	<li>Click the properties tab.</li>\n	<li>On the line named \"DiskGroupName\" Type the name of the disk group, as it appear in Veritas into the Value field.</li>\n	<li>Click ok.</li>\n</ol>\nYou should probably rename the application and resource you just created so they are easily identifiable later.\n\nFor me this didn\'t work right away due to some sort of locking that was happening on one of the nodes. A reboot fixed that issue.\n\nUpdate: 2010/05/06 - Started having some problems when bringing the Volume Manager Disk Group online. The act of bringing the resource online seems to crash the cluster! I\'m currently talking with our storage team about the issue. We have identified a FUGLY work around. Put the disk group in a deported state. Then right after creating the Volume Manager Disk Group cluster resource, detach it from the cluster application so it\'s in available storage. Then you can bring it online...eventually. By eventually I mean that it seems to be very picky about when you enter the DiskGroupName.\n\nWe are still trying to figure out what\'s going on with this and will probably be contacting Symantec support on the issue due to the cluster crashing implication.\n\nUpdate 2012/06/13 - I know it\'s been a while but I noticed I never brought this post to a conclusion. (my bad). This document was shown to me that contains all you will need to know to make Veritas Storage Foundation work with 2008 R2 clustering. <a href=\"http://sfdoccentral.symantec.com/sf/5.1SP2/windows/pdf/SFW_MSCS_SQL2008_Solutions_51SP2.pdf\">http://sfdoccentral.symantec.com/sf/5.1SP2/windows/pdf/SFW_MSCS_SQL2008_Solutions_51SP2.pdf</a>",">Server 2008 R2 Clustering using Dynamic disks with Veritas Stoage Foundation","","publish","open","open","","server-2008-r2-clustering-using-dynamic-disks-with-veritas-stoage-foundation","","","2012-06-13 13:34:29","2012-06-13 13:34:29","","0","http://practicalkungfu.net/?p=55","0","post","","0");

It may still be a product of the CU we are on (aug 2011) and may be fixed in a later CU. I will probably never end up finding out for sure. :(\n\nJust an FYI, if you have a large user base expect this to create a LOT of pictures. I believe it creates 3 different pictures sizes for each user. It shouldn\'t be a problem because of sharepoint 2010\'s list and library limits (unless you have over 10 million employees). :)","User profile pictures won\'t update in SharePoint 2010 (There!

(just a standard usb multi-card reader)\n<strong>Files needed:</strong> Most of the files needed can be found here: <a href=\"http://documentation.dbernhardt.com/pfsense/article.html\">http://documentation.dbernhardt.com/pfsense/article.html</a> (This was by far the most complete how to for installing pfsense on a Watchguard that I found.)\nSerial cable: I used one of the billions that accumulated from working with HP Procurve network equipment.\n\nFirst take the top cover off the x750e.\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\" href=\"http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-ciXq6KJ-Pso/T0HBgy5LzFI/AAAAAAAAA7A/eINK37Du3T8/s1600/topcoveroff.jpg\"><img src=\"http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-ciXq6KJ-Pso/T0HBgy5LzFI/AAAAAAAAA7A/eINK37Du3T8/s400/topcoveroff.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"298\" height=\"400\" border=\"0\" /></a></div>\nThere are a bunch of un-soldered connectors for things like VGA, USB, etc... which can be connected if desired. However for this I wanted to avoid soldering. :)\n\nRemove watchguard supplied CF card (256mb in my case) and insert into CF card reader on your computer. (I used a Dynex card reader from the local electronics store). <strong>Disclaimer: you are about to wipe out the factory software that came with your firewall!</strong>\n<blockquote class=\"tr_bq\">physdiskwrite freedosbios.img</blockquote>\nOnce it\'s done writing the image, copy X750EB6.BIN to bios directory on cf card if it\'s not already there. (Note: There are several x750eB#.bin files that can be used. I\'ve seen reports that 2 and 4 also worked for people. Only 6 worked for me.)\n\nPlace the 256MB CF card back in the firewall.\n\nConnect to the console via serial using 9600 baud and power on the firewall.\n\n<strong>Just a FYI to everyone. Yes you are about to flash the bios. This really doesn\'t change anything, it just enables the console output for the bios so we can change some hard drive settings to allow the firewall to boot off a larger media. If you don\'t want to do this, but still want to run something other that the factory software, you can flash Monowall on the 256MB CF card. Monowall requires much less space that pfsense and will run with no bios modifications.</strong>\n\nOnce freedos has booted you will see a C:\\ prompt:\n<blockquote class=\"tr_bq\">C:\\&gt;cd bios\nC:\\BIOS&gt;awdflash.exe X750EB6.BIN /py /sn /cc /e</blockquote>\n<blockquote class=\"tr_bq\">C:\\BIOS&gt;</blockquote>\nPower off the firewall and remove the 265mb CF card.\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"></div>\nPut the 4GB card into the CF reader.\n\nFlash pfsense onto 4 GB card\n<blockquote class=\"tr_bq\">physdiskwrite -u filename.img</blockquote>\n-use -u for cf cards larger than 2gb\n-filename.img should be replaced with the name of the pfsense image you downloaded.\n\nPlace 4GB CF card in the firewall now that it has pfsense on it and connect to the console via serial at 19200 baud.\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\" href=\"http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-mD1B9ChO74k/T0HBmLrtpfI/AAAAAAAAA7I/2yyqWcbxzAo/s1600/replacementcf.jpg\"><img src=\"http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-mD1B9ChO74k/T0HBmLrtpfI/AAAAAAAAA7I/2yyqWcbxzAo/s400/replacementcf.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"298\" height=\"400\" border=\"0\" /></a></div>\nPower on the firewall.\n\nYou should see the post in a few seconds. <strong>Instead of pressing del to enter the bios press tab since you are on a console</strong>.\n\nGo into what is normally the hard drive settings and you should see the CF card detected. If it\'s not or all values are set to 0, set to auto detection and it should set some values. Now change the following:\n\nSet for:\n<blockquote class=\"tr_bq\">IDE Channel 0 Master      [Manual]\nAccess Mode               [CHS]\nHead                      [    2]</blockquote>\nSave the BIOS and exit. (If you ever need to remove the CF card again you may have to go back in and reset the above values.\nBios will be on 115200 baud from now on after first boot just in case you ever need to get back in there:\n\nConnect to console on 9600 to do initial pfsense configuration. If you see pfsense booting then you should be good to go.\n\nThe initial configuration is done from the console. (obviously configuration are going to differ after this point. the rest of this article is just for getting a basic configuration up and running.\n\nJust leave the WAN set to DHCP for now, and give the LAN interface the normal 192.168.1.1 address.\nFor interfaces I like to use SK0 as the wan interface and SK1 and the lan interface. (SK0 is first from the left of the 8. SK1 is the second from the left.\n\nTo test you can connect a computer to the LAN interface and see if you get an IP address. If so point your browser at https://192.168.1.1 and you should get a pfsense login page.\nLogin: admin\nPassword: pfsense\n\nThe last thing I\'d recomend doing is enabling SSH access. You will need to it fix the fan noise.\n\npfsense will take you through a small wizard to get the rest of the basic configuration up and running.\n\n<strong>Post x750e install tasks/fixes:</strong>\n<strong>LOUD NOISES!</strong>\nThe 3 10000 RPM fans in the back of this box present a problem. Noise. There is a wonderful little program that someone wrote called WGXepc. It allows you to clock down the fans in software when pfsense boots. Here is the basic setup:\n\nQuick note about fan speed. (The default speed is FF. We are going to set the speed to 10. That may be too slow though. You should monitor your environment and set accordingly based on need.)\n\nAdd the following line to WGXepc.sh\n/usr/local/etc/rc.d/WGXepc -f 10\n\nConnect using WINscp or ther secure copy tool as root and your pfsense admin password.\n\ncopy WGXepc and WGXepc.sh to using WINSCP:\n/tmp\n\nLogin using through SSH (I used putty) with root and your pfsense admin password.\n\nMount FS as read write\n/etc/rc.conf_mount_rw\n\ncp WGXepc /usr/local/bin\ncp WGXepc.sh /usr/local/etc/rc.d/\n\nchmod 0755 /usr/local/bin/WGXepc\nchmod 0755 /usr/local/etc/rc.d/WGXepc.sh\n\n/etc/rc.conf_mount_ro\n\nshutdown -r now\nor\nrun this to set the fan speed now: WGXepc -f 10\n\nAll changes done with this command are immediate. Also a system update will remove these settings. You will have to reapply them.\n\nWGXepc will also control the Arm/Disarm light on the front of the x750e. :)\n\nHere are the arguments the command accepts:\n\n-f (fan) will return the current fan speed or if followed by a number in hex, 00-FF, will set it.\n-l (led) will set the arm/disarm to the second argument:\nred, green, red_flash, green_flash, off\n\n<strong>Clock down the CPU</strong>\nIn the web interface goto System-&gt;Advanced-&gt;Miscellaneous.\nEnable PowerD\n\nIf you see the following in the system log happening a lot:\n<blockquote class=\"tr_bq\">kernel: timecounter TSC must not be in use when changing frequencies; change denied</blockquote>\nAdd the following to Advanced-&gt;System Tunables to fix the issue.\n\nTunable: kern.timecounter.hardware\nValue: i8254\n\n<strong>Sources:</strong>\n<a href=\"http://nettechonline.net/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=78:x700-led-fix-pfsense-on-watchguard&amp;catid=49:pfsense-watchguard&amp;Itemid=58\">http://nettechonline.net/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=78:x700-led-fix-pfsense-on-watchguard&amp;catid=49:pfsense-watchguard&amp;Itemid=58</a>\n<a href=\"http://forum.pfsense.org/index.php?topic=32013.65;wap2\">http://forum.pfsense.org/index.php?topic=32013.65;wap2</a>\n<a href=\"http://documentation.dbernhardt.com/pfsense/article.html\">http://documentation.dbernhardt.com/pfsense/article.html</a>\n<a href=\"http://doc.pfsense.org/index.php/Remount_embedded_filesystem_as_read-write\">http://doc.pfsense.org/index.php/Remount_embedded_filesystem_as_read-write</a>\n\nThere you have it. You should have pfsense working on the x750e hardware. Also if you don\'t want to go the full route of flashing a new bios, you can also put Monowall on the 256MB card that comes with the firewall as mentioned before. Monowall requires a lot less space than pfsense. There are some features you won\'t get with Monowall that exist in pfsense UPNP and OS fingerprinting for example, but Monowall is a really solid firewall platform. pfsense was actually forked from Monowall.\n\nThe most aggravating part of all this work was finding a working computer that still has a COM port. :)\n\n<strong>Update 2012-02-20: </strong>A couple thing to add. First I didn\'t realize this but it appears that there is no way to re-size the tmp volume. This is significant because it\'s one of two volumes on pfsense embedded that is created as a ram disk (the other is var). This is significant because tmp is where squidguard and other packages store their updates/blacklists. Essentially if you are going to use pfsense in an embedded configuration (on CF card for example) then you are setting up for access control type functions only. Although I was able to get snort working on the x750e with CF card.\n\nIncidentally if you do a df -h from the console, you will see a total of only about 2 GB total for the entire file system. If you are using a 4 GB card the other 2 GB is used for creating a separate slice that can be booted for testing configs and other stuff. Its kinda handy if you have a working config and want to try something out without breaking your \"production\" config.\n\nI guess I\'m going to start researching mounting a SATA or IDE drive in the x750e.\n\n2012-7-14 Update: The other day I was looking at the dashboard and I noticed that I\'ve been running this setup with Snort active for 90 days without reboot. :) So far I\'ve been very happy with the setup. Snort has been a little temperamental and there have been some rules I\'ve had to create exclusions for, but over all this thing has been rock solid.",">How to install pfsense 2.0 on a Watchguard x750e Core","","publish","open","open","","how-to-install-pfsense-2-0-on-a-watchguard-x750e-core","","","2012-07-14 16:25:43","2012-07-14 16:25:43","","0","http://practicalkungfu.net/?p=62","0","post","","6");

Just create a UPA and UPA proxy per normal.\n\nThe only gotcha here is if your netbios domain name on one or both of your domains doesn’t match it’s DNS name. See the below section if you fall into that case.\n\n<strong>Setting up the UPA for netbios Support</strong>\n\nThis is only required if one, or both, of your domain’s netbios name doesn’t match the DNS name. FYI, this has to be done before starting the user profile sync service.\n\nTo check to see if NetbiosDomainNames are enabled run the following powershell commands.\n<pre class=\"brush: powershell; gutter: true\">$upsa = Get-SPServiceApplication | where {$_.DisplayName -eq &quot;User Profile Service Application&quot;}\n$upsa.NetBIOSDomainNamesEnabled</pre>\nSince this is a new UPA it should return a false.

This will need to be done for both forests even if the netbios condition only applies to one of your forests.\n\nTo start ADSIedit Click Start-&gt;Run and type adsiedit.msc\n\nRight click on ADSI Edit and click Connect To…\n\nIn the pull down for “Select a well known Naming Context” choose Configuration\n\n<a href=\"http://practicalkungfu.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/ADSIsettings.png\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-131\" title=\"ADSIsettings\" src=\"http://practicalkungfu.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/ADSIsettings.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"380\" height=\"291\" /></a>\n\nRight click on the configuration container and select properties.

One will be for pulling the display information (resource forest) for the users (displayname, firstname, manager, etc). The other is for the logon forest, this will be the account actually used by the user (what they login to their machine with).\n\nHow does this work? SharePoint actually makes a connection between the two accounts by looking at the msDS-SourceObjectDN AD attribute in the resource forest. msDS-SourceObjectDN should be populated with the DN of the logon forest’s account.\n\n(If you’re running exchange in a logon/resource domain config chances are you are already doing something similar with the msExchMasterAccountSid to create linked mailboxes. Ask your AD and or Exchange admins, they can probably help get the msDS-SourceObjectDN set on the resource domain.)\n\nGoto Central Admin-&gt;Application Management-&gt;Manage Service Applications-&gt;User Profile Service Application\n<ul>\n	<li>Click Configure Synchronization Connections</li>\n	<li>Add a new connection</li>\n	<li>Set type to Active Directory Resource</li>\n	<li>Enter your forest and sync user information for the resource forest</li>\n	<li>Then select the OUs you want to sync.</li>\n	<li>Click ok</li>\n</ul>\n<div><a href=\"http://practicalkungfu.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/resourceforestconnection.png\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-136\" title=\"resourceforestconnection\" src=\"http://practicalkungfu.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/resourceforestconnection-1024x355.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"584\" height=\"202\" /></a></div>\nSetting up the logon forest connection is almost the same process.

It would be bad.</strong>\n\nNow that the warning is out of the way you can look inside all you want, in fact the FIM client is invaluable for troubleshooting sync issues.\n\nThere are a lot of errors that can appear in here, but the one I’ve come across the most is when you get an operation status of stopped-connectivity. If you click on the job and then look in the connection status window, it should show the name of a domain controller. Click on the name of the DC and a new window will appear. It will show you the cause of the error. In this case it’s usually Replication ccess was denied, which means the replicating directory changes permission aren’t setup correctly.\n\n<a href=\"http://practicalkungfu.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/replicationaccessdenied.png\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-138\" title=\"replicationaccessdenied\" src=\"http://practicalkungfu.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/replicationaccessdenied.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"261\" height=\"243\" /></a>\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<strong>Parting notes</strong>\n\nBeware sIDHistory:\n\n<a href=\"http://blogs.technet.com/b/rgullick/archive/2010/05/15/sharepoint-people-picker.aspx\">http://blogs.technet.com/b/rgullick/archive/2010/05/15/sharepoint-people-picker.aspx</a>\n\nApparently there is a condition that the people pick will have problems with if you use sIDHistory.I mention it now because if you have a resource and logon forest setup, you may be in the middle of a domain migration. The 10000ft view of this issue is that the people picker searches over two way trusts. It will then see the SID in the sIDHistory attribute on the stub account as well as the original logon account objectSID. This confuses and angers the people picker causing it not be able to resolve users. End result you can\'t set permissions or add users to people and group fields. This could potentially impact my site creation and work flows (probably some other stuff to). You can probably get around this issue by setting the search scope of the people picker for each site collection, however this will get messy fast if you have more that one logon domain.

Ask your AD and or Exchange admins, they can probably help get the msDS-SourceObjectDN set on the resource domain.)\n\nGoto Central Admin-&gt;Application Management-&gt;Manage Service Applications-&gt;User Profile Service Application\n<ul>\n	<li>Click Configure Synchronization Connections</li>\n	<li>Add a new connection</li>\n	<li>Set type to Active Directory Resource</li>\n	<li>Enter your forest and sync user information for the resource forest</li>\n	<li>Then select the OUs you want to sync.</li>\n	<li>Click ok</li>\n</ul>\n<div><a href=\"http://practicalkungfu.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/resourceforestconnection.png\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-136\" title=\"resourceforestconnection\" src=\"http://practicalkungfu.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/resourceforestconnection-1024x355.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"584\" height=\"202\" /></a></div>\nSetting up the logon forest connection is almost the same process.

It will then see the SID in the sIDHistory attribute on the stub account as well as the original logon account objectSID. This confuses and angers the people picker causing it not be able to resolve users. End result you can\'t set permissions or add users to people and group fields. This could potentially impact my site creation and work flows (probably some other stuff to). You can probably get around this issue by setting the search scope of the people picker for each site collection, however this will get messy fast if you have more that one logon domain.

You can get around the SIDHistory issue by not using the people picker and just typing in users in the format domain2\\username and then clicking the resolve button. Although I don\'t think thats a realistic option.\n\nUpdate 2012-4-16: we ran this in in production. It seems to have worked pretty well. I\'ve updated the script though because of some bad programming on my part. Apparently it\'s important to null out your variables if they are going to be reused in a for loop. :) Needless to say there were some issues, but happily not as many as there could have been. I\'ll updating the script to reflect these additions. I think I also need to add some logic to detect if the get-ADuser returns nothing exit the if statement. I\'ll update the script once I get it figured out.\n\n&nbsp;","SharePoint 2010 Changing from ADFS Claims to Windows Claims","","publish","open","open","","sharepoint-2010-changing-from-saml-claims-to-windows-claims","","","2012-07-26 23:54:26","2012-07-26 23:54:26","","0","http://practicalkungfu.net/?p=63","0","post","","0");

Both scripts are linked below.</span>\n<span style=\"font-family: \'Segoe UI\', Verdana, Arial;\">\n</span>\n<span style=\"font-family: \'Segoe UI\', Verdana, Arial;\">SCRIPTS:</span>\n<span style=\"font-family: \'Segoe UI\', Verdana, Arial;\"><a href=\"https://sites.google.com/a/tupkers.net/pkf/home/scripts/SP2010-Migrate-AllUserstoWinClaims%20-%20Generic.ps1?attredirects=0&amp;d=1\">Migrate to Windows authentication</a></span>\n<span style=\"font-family: \'Segoe UI\', Verdana, Arial;\"><a href=\"https://sites.google.com/a/tupkers.net/pkf/home/scripts/SP2010-Migrate-AllUserstoADFSClaims%20-%20Generic.ps1?attredirects=0&amp;d=1\">Migrate to ADFS authentication</a></span>\n\nUPDATE: I forgot to mention that if you have SIDhistory set in your stub account domain (domain1 in the example) then the people picker will have all kinds of problems with Windows authentication. (so will Exchange 2010 and granting access to shared mailboxes). I\'d recommend this post. <a href=\"http://blogs.technet.com/b/rgullick/archive/2010/05/15/sharepoint-people-picker.aspx\">http://blogs.technet.com/b/rgullick/archive/2010/05/15/sharepoint-people-picker.aspx</a> It explains the issue with SIDhistory very well. You can get around the SIDHistory issue by not using the people picker and just typing in users in the format domain2\\username and then clicking the resolve button. Although I don\'t think thats a realistic option.\n\nUpdate 2012-4-16: we ran this in in production. It seems to have worked pretty well. I\'ve updated the script though because of some bad programming on my part. Apparently it\'s important to null out your variables if they are going to be reused in a for loop. :) Needless to say there were some issues, but happily not as many as there could have been. I\'ll updating the script to reflect these additions. I think I also need to add some logic to detect if the get-ADuser returns nothing exit the if statement. I\'ll update the script once I get it figured out.\n\n&nbsp;",">SharePoint 2010 Changing from SAML Claims to Windows Claims","","inherit","open","open","","63-revision-2","","","2012-04-16 21:32:59","2012-04-16 21:32:59","","63","http://practicalkungfu.net/?p=80","0","revision","","0");

I ran the following to correctly set them.\n<pre class=\"brush: powershell; gutter: true\">$wa = Get-SPWebApplication webappURL\n$wa.properties[&quot;portalsuperuseraccount&quot;] = &quot;domain\\svcsp-cacheuser&quot;\n$wa.properties[&quot;portalsuperreaderaccount&quot;] = &quot;domain\\svcsp-cachereader&quot;\n$wa.update()</pre>\nThe change should take effect right away and not cause downtime.\n\nIn retrospect the some of the text in the events do kind of lean toward the issue being something with the publishing features. However it was hard to get past the \"Server out of memory\" error. I\'m sure that makes some kind of sense on a technical level but it\'s a very vague and misleading error. I hope this helps someone.","SharePoint 2010: Server out of memory in ULS log?","","publish","open","open","","sharepoint-2010-server-out-of-memory-in-uls-log","","","2012-05-23 20:27:21","2012-05-23 20:27:21","","0","http://practicalkungfu.net/?p=96","0","post","","3");

I wasn\'t sure what I was going to do with it. I was just excited about finding an fairly good enterprise level firewall at a ham fest.\n\nFast forward about a year. I came across an article about modding the x750e. After digging deeper I found that people were installing pfsense on them. OMG! I took apart the x750e and sure enough it is essentially just a 1.4 GHz celeron with 512MB ram and and 256MB SanDisk CF card in it. (plus a few other things)\n\nI looked around for a how to but all I could find was a bunch of hard to follow forum posts (and one pretty well documented process, but it seemed to be missing some stuff). Not that they were bad information (I mean I was able to get the thing working based of them), but it was all a bit disconnected.\n\nSo here is my walk through. If I\'m missing anything or if I plain got something wrong please leave a comment and I\'ll fix the post.\n\n<strong>OS used:</strong> Windows XP (for hyperterminal. However any terminal capable app will do).\n<strong>Hyper terminal settings:</strong> Outside of the baud all settings were default.\n<strong>Pfsense:</strong> current stable release (2.0.1 as of this article)\n<strong>Replacement CF card:</strong> SanDisk 4 GB Ultra (due to pfsense needing at least a 512MB installation target with current requirements.)\n<strong>Card reader: </strong>Dynex all in 1. (just a standard usb multi-card reader)\n<strong>Files needed:</strong> Most of the files needed can be found here: <a href=\"http://documentation.dbernhardt.com/pfsense/article.html\">http://documentation.dbernhardt.com/pfsense/article.html</a> (This was by far the most complete how to for installing pfsense on a Watchguard that I found.)\nSerial cable: I used one of the billions that accumulated from working with HP Procurve network equipment.\n\nFirst take the top cover off the x750e.\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\" href=\"http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-ciXq6KJ-Pso/T0HBgy5LzFI/AAAAAAAAA7A/eINK37Du3T8/s1600/topcoveroff.jpg\"><img src=\"http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-ciXq6KJ-Pso/T0HBgy5LzFI/AAAAAAAAA7A/eINK37Du3T8/s400/topcoveroff.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"298\" height=\"400\" border=\"0\" /></a></div>\nThere are a bunch of un-soldered connectors for things like VGA, USB, etc... which can be connected if desired. However for this I wanted to avoid soldering. :)\n\nRemove watchguard supplied CF card (256mb in my case) and insert into CF card reader on your computer. (I used a Dynex card reader from the local electronics store). <strong>Disclaimer: you are about to wipe out the factory software that came with your firewall!</strong>\n<blockquote class=\"tr_bq\">physdiskwrite freedosbios.img</blockquote>\nOnce it\'s done writing the image, copy X750EB6.BIN to bios directory on cf card if it\'s not already there. (Note: There are several x750eB#.bin files that can be used. I\'ve seen reports that 2 and 4 also worked for people. Only 6 worked for me.)\n\nPlace the 256MB CF card back in the firewall.\n\nConnect to the console via serial using 9600 baud and power on the firewall.\n\n<strong>Just a FYI to everyone. Yes you are about to flash the bios. This really doesn\'t change anything, it just enables the console output for the bios so we can change some hard drive settings to allow the firewall to boot off a larger media. If you don\'t want to do this, but still want to run something other that the factory software, you can flash Monowall on the 256MB CF card. Monowall requires much less space that pfsense and will run with no bios modifications.</strong>\n\nOnce freedos has booted you will see a C:\\ prompt:\n<blockquote class=\"tr_bq\">C:\\&gt;cd bios\nC:\\BIOS&gt;awdflash.exe X750EB6.BIN /py /sn /cc /e</blockquote>\n<blockquote class=\"tr_bq\">C:\\BIOS&gt;</blockquote>\nPower off the firewall and remove the 265mb CF card.\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"></div>\nPut the 4GB card into the CF reader.\n\nFlash pfsense onto 4 GB card\n<blockquote class=\"tr_bq\">physdiskwrite -u filename.img</blockquote>\n-use -u for cf cards larger than 2gb\n-filename.img should be replaced with the name of the pfsense image you downloaded.\n\nPlace 4GB CF card in the firewall now that it has pfsense on it and connect to the console via serial at 19200 baud.\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\" href=\"http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-mD1B9ChO74k/T0HBmLrtpfI/AAAAAAAAA7I/2yyqWcbxzAo/s1600/replacementcf.jpg\"><img src=\"http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-mD1B9ChO74k/T0HBmLrtpfI/AAAAAAAAA7I/2yyqWcbxzAo/s400/replacementcf.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"298\" height=\"400\" border=\"0\" /></a></div>\nPower on the firewall.\n\nYou should see the post in a few seconds. <strong>Instead of pressing del to enter the bios press tab since you are on a console</strong>.\n\nGo into what is normally the hard drive settings and you should see the CF card detected. If it\'s not or all values are set to 0, set to auto detection and it should set some values. Now change the following:\n\nSet for:\n<blockquote class=\"tr_bq\">IDE Channel 0 Master      [Manual]\nAccess Mode               [CHS]\nHead                      [    2]</blockquote>\nSave the BIOS and exit. (If you ever need to remove the CF card again you may have to go back in and reset the above values.\nBios will be on 115200 baud from now on after first boot just in case you ever need to get back in there:\n\nConnect to console on 9600 to do initial pfsense configuration. If you see pfsense booting then you should be good to go.\n\nThe initial configuration is done from the console. (obviously configuration are going to differ after this point. the rest of this article is just for getting a basic configuration up and running.\n\nJust leave the WAN set to DHCP for now, and give the LAN interface the normal 192.168.1.1 address.\nFor interfaces I like to use SK0 as the wan interface and SK1 and the lan interface. (SK0 is first from the left of the 8. SK1 is the second from the left.\n\nTo test you can connect a computer to the LAN interface and see if you get an IP address. If so point your browser at https://192.168.1.1 and you should get a pfsense login page.\nLogin: admin\nPassword: pfsense\n\nThe last thing I\'d recomend doing is enabling SSH access. You will need to it fix the fan noise.\n\npfsense will take you through a small wizard to get the rest of the basic configuration up and running.\n\n<strong>Post x750e install tasks/fixes:</strong>\n<strong>LOUD NOISES!</strong>\nThe 3 10000 RPM fans in the back of this box present a problem. Noise. There is a wonderful little program that someone wrote called WGXepc. It allows you to clock down the fans in software when pfsense boots. Here is the basic setup:\n\nQuick note about fan speed. (The default speed is FF. We are going to set the speed to 10. That may be too slow though. You should monitor your environment and set accordingly based on need.)\n\nAdd the following line to WGXepc.sh\n/usr/local/etc/rc.d/WGXepc -f 10\n\nConnect using WINscp or ther secure copy tool as root and your pfsense admin password.\n\ncopy WGXepc and WGXepc.sh to using WINSCP:\n/tmp\n\nLogin using through SSH (I used putty) with root and your pfsense admin password.\n\nMount FS as read write\n/etc/rc.conf_mount_rw\n\ncp WGXepc /usr/local/bin\ncp WGXepc.sh /usr/local/etc/rc.d/\n\nchmod 0755 /usr/local/bin/WGXepc\nchmod 0755 /usr/local/etc/rc.d/WGXepc.sh\n\n/etc/rc.conf_mount_ro\n\nshutdown -r now\nor\nrun this to set the fan speed now: WGXepc -f 10\n\nAll changes done with this command are immediate. Also a system update will remove these settings. You will have to reapply them.\n\nWGXepc will also control the Arm/Disarm light on the front of the x750e. :)\n\nHere are the arguments the command accepts:\n\n-f (fan) will return the current fan speed or if followed by a number in hex, 00-FF, will set it.\n-l (led) will set the arm/disarm to the second argument:\nred, green, red_flash, green_flash, off\n\n<strong>Clock down the CPU</strong>\nIn the web interface goto System-&gt;Advanced-&gt;Miscellaneous.\nEnable PowerD\n\nIf you see the following in the system log happening a lot:\n<blockquote class=\"tr_bq\">kernel: timecounter TSC must not be in use when changing frequencies; change denied</blockquote>\nAdd the following to Advanced-&gt;System Tunables to fix the issue.\n\nTunable: kern.timecounter.hardware\nValue: i8254\n\n<strong>Sources:</strong>\n<a href=\"http://nettechonline.net/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=78:x700-led-fix-pfsense-on-watchguard&amp;catid=49:pfsense-watchguard&amp;Itemid=58\">http://nettechonline.net/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=78:x700-led-fix-pfsense-on-watchguard&amp;catid=49:pfsense-watchguard&amp;Itemid=58</a>\n<a href=\"http://forum.pfsense.org/index.php?topic=32013.65;wap2\">http://forum.pfsense.org/index.php?topic=32013.65;wap2</a>\n<a href=\"http://documentation.dbernhardt.com/pfsense/article.html\">http://documentation.dbernhardt.com/pfsense/article.html</a>\n<a href=\"http://doc.pfsense.org/index.php/Remount_embedded_filesystem_as_read-write\">http://doc.pfsense.org/index.php/Remount_embedded_filesystem_as_read-write</a>\n\nThere you have it. You should have pfsense working on the x750e hardware. Also if you don\'t want to go the full route of flashing a new bios, you can also put Monowall on the 256MB card that comes with the firewall as mentioned before. Monowall requires a lot less space than pfsense. There are some features you won\'t get with Monowall that exist in pfsense UPNP and OS fingerprinting for example, but Monowall is a really solid firewall platform. pfsense was actually forked from Monowall.\n\nThe most aggravating part of all this work was finding a working computer that still has a COM port. :)\n\n<strong>Update 2012-02-20: </strong>A couple thing to add. First I didn\'t realize this but it appears that there is no way to re-size the tmp volume. This is significant because it\'s one of two volumes on pfsense embedded that is created as a ram disk (the other is var). This is significant because tmp is where squidguard and other packages store their updates/blacklists. Essentially if you are going to use pfsense in an embedded configuration (on CF card for example) then you are setting up for access control type functions only. Although I was able to get snort working on the x750e with CF card.\n\nIncidentally if you do a df -h from the console, you will see a total of only about 2 GB total for the entire file system. If you are using a 4 GB card the other 2 GB is used for creating a separate slice that can be booted for testing configs and other stuff. Its kinda handy if you have a working config and want to try something out without breaking your \"production\" config.\n\nI guess I\'m going to start researching mounting a SATA or IDE drive in the x750e.\n\n2012-7-14 Update: The other day I was looking at the dashboard and I noticed that I\'ve been running this setup with Snort active for 90 days without reboot. :) So far I\'ve been very happy with the setup. Snort has been a little temperamental and there have been some rules I\'ve had to create exclusions for, but over all this thing has been rock solid.

You have two domains (or more), you are trying to go through a domain consolidation onto one domain. So you have multiple user domains, an another (main) domain with enabled or disabled user accounts (stub accounts) that correspond to the users out in the user domains. Your Sharepoint 2010 environment exists in this \"main\" domain also. because of this scenario you configured SharePoint to use ADFS claims only (no windows authentication for users)\n\nSummarry:\nDomain1 - main domain, contains stub accounts and the SharePoint 2010 environment.\nDomain2-# - legacy user domains, contains user accounts actually used by the end users.\n\nSharePoint 2010 - setup to use only ADFS claims for user authentication.

The msDS-SourceObjectDN attribute can be used to determine the users home domain which is done in the two IF statements. If the msDS-SourceObjectDN matches the IF statement condition it will change the users identity in SharePoint.

You will also want to add all service accounts used with SharePoint to the exclusion statement and any others you deem necessary. (You really only need to add the superreader, super writer, and crawl service accounts to the exclusion list, but I though it would be good to add all managed accounts to be safe.</span>\n<span style=\"font-family: \'Segoe UI\', Verdana, Arial;\">\n</span>\n<span style=\"font-family: \'Segoe UI\', Verdana, Arial;\">Before or after running the script (I did this before) change the authentication for the web application to NTLM or kerberos claims, (disabling the ADFS provider).</span>\n<span style=\"font-family: \'Segoe UI\', Verdana, Arial;\">\n</span>\n<span style=\"font-family: \'Segoe UI\', Verdana, Arial;\">The script may take a long time to run depending on the size of your environment so i\'d recommend running this after hours on a weekend.

(so will Exchange 2010 and granting access to shared mailboxes). I\'d recommend this post. <a href=\"http://blogs.technet.com/b/rgullick/archive/2010/05/15/sharepoint-people-picker.aspx\">http://blogs.technet.com/b/rgullick/archive/2010/05/15/sharepoint-people-picker.aspx</a> It explains the issue with SIDhistory very well. You can get around the SIDHistory issue by not using the people picker and just typing in users in the format domain2\\username and then clicking the resolve button. Although I don\'t think thats a realistic option.\n\nUpdate 2012-4-16: we ran this in in production. It seems to have worked pretty well. I\'ve updated the script though because of some bad programming on my part. Apparently it\'s important to null out your variables if they are going to be reused in a for loop. :) Needless to say there were some issues, but happily not as many as there could have been. I\'ll updating the script to reflect these additions. I think I also need to add some logic to detect if the get-ADuser returns nothing exit the if statement. I\'ll update the script once I get it figured out.\n\n&nbsp;",">SharePoint 2010 Changing from SAML Claims to Windows Claims","","inherit","open","open","","63-autosave","","","2012-04-16 21:34:07","2012-04-16 21:34:07","","63","http://practicalkungfu.net/?p=78","0","revision","","0");

So you have multiple user domains, an another (main) domain with enabled or disabled user accounts (stub accounts) that correspond to the users out in the user domains. Your Sharepoint 2010 environment exists in this \"main\" domain also. because of this scenario you configured SharePoint to use ADFS claims only (no windows authentication for users)<br /><br />Summarry:<br />Domain1 - main domain, contains stub accounts and the SharePoint 2010 environment.<br />Domain2-# - legacy user domains, contains user accounts actually used by the end users.<br /><br />SharePoint 2010 - setup to use only ADFS claims for user authentication.

For ever user in every subweb, it will lookup the user\'s AD object based on their mail attribute (also stored in&nbsp;SharePoint), and returns their&nbsp;msDS-SourceObjectDN and attributes. The&nbsp;msDS-SourceObjectDN attribute can be used to determine the users home domain which is done in the two IF statements. If the&nbsp;msDS-SourceObjectDN matches the IF statement condition it will change the users identity in&nbsp;SharePoint. The new identites are built off the samaccountname from the get-aduser command.</span><br /><span style=\"font-family: \'Segoe UI\', Verdana, Arial;\"><br /></span><br /><span style=\"font-family: \'Segoe UI\', Verdana, Arial;\">There are a few things that you will need to change in the script. Most&nbsp;noticeably&nbsp;are the domain names, and the $sourceDN comparisons in the IF statements. Also duplicate the IF statements for each domain that you have users in. You will also want to add all service accounts used with SharePoint to the&nbsp;exclusion&nbsp;statement and any others you deem necessary. (You really only need to add the superreader, super writer, and crawl service accounts to the exclusion list, but I though it would be good to add all managed accounts to be safe.</span><br /><span style=\"font-family: \'Segoe UI\', Verdana, Arial;\"><br /></span><br /><span style=\"font-family: \'Segoe UI\', Verdana, Arial;\">Before or after running the script (I did this before) change the authentication for the web application to NTLM or kerberos claims, (disabling the ADFS provider).</span><br /><span style=\"font-family: \'Segoe UI\', Verdana, Arial;\"><br /></span><br /><span style=\"font-family: \'Segoe UI\', Verdana, Arial;\">The script may take a long time to run depending on the size of your environment so i\'d&nbsp;recommend&nbsp;running this after hours on a weekend. Also in our scenario we were trying to work toward consolidating domains, so we will likely have to do this kind of process for&nbsp;every-time&nbsp;we collapse a user domain into domain1.</span><br /><span style=\"font-family: \'Segoe UI\', Verdana, Arial;\"><br /></span><br /><span style=\"font-family: \'Segoe UI\', Verdana, Arial;\">I also felt it prudent to write a reversal script. The resversal script undoes the identity change only, it will basically do the same thing as the ADFS to windows script. It just changes back to an ADFS claim ID (which is WAY easier). Both scripts are linked below.</span><br /><span style=\"font-family: \'Segoe UI\', Verdana, Arial;\"><br /></span><br /><span style=\"font-family: \'Segoe UI\', Verdana, Arial;\">SCRIPTS:</span><br /><span style=\"font-family: \'Segoe UI\', Verdana, Arial;\"><a href=\"https://sites.google.com/a/tupkers.net/pkf/home/scripts/SP2010-Migrate-AllUserstoWinClaims%20-%20Generic.ps1?attredirects=0&amp;d=1\">Migrate to Windows authentication</a></span><br /><span style=\"font-family: \'Segoe UI\', Verdana, Arial;\"><a href=\"https://sites.google.com/a/tupkers.net/pkf/home/scripts/SP2010-Migrate-AllUserstoADFSClaims%20-%20Generic.ps1?attredirects=0&amp;d=1\">Migrate to ADFS authentication</a></span><br /><br />UPDATE: I forgot to mention that if you have SIDhistory set in your stub account domain (domain1 in the example) then the people picker will have all kinds of problems with Windows authentication.

I was trying to setup a Windows 2008 R2 cluster for use as a SQL 2008 R2 cluster. However the SAN storage I was given was created as dynamic partitions which isn\'t natively supported in Windows clustering, but is supported using Veritas Storage Foundation.\n\nNo matter how many times you try and add a new disk to the cluster it will tell you, \"No disks suitable for cluster disks were found. For diagnostic information about disks available to the cluster, use the Validate a Configuration Wizard to run Storage tests.\" But the validation test won\'t show usable storage.\n\nFirst you need to make sure that the Cluster Option for Microsoft Cluster Service (MSCS)/Failover Cluster is installed in Veritas Storage Foundation. You will need a license for this feature otherwise the check box will be greyed out. The feature can be added using Programs and Features in the control panel.\n\nTo actually make the cluster see the storage you first need to create an Empty Service or Application in the Failover Cluster Manager.\n<ol>\n	<li>Right click on Services and application</li>\n	<li>Select more actions</li>\n	<li>Select Create Empty Service or Application</li>\n</ol>\nNext you must add a Volume Manager Disk Group to the empty application you just created.\n<ol>\n	<li>Right click on the clustered application you just created.</li>\n	<li>Select Add a resource</li>\n	<li>Select More Resources</li>\n	<li>select 9 - Add Volume Manager Disk Group</li>\n</ol>\nNow you have to tell the new disk group you created what the name of the disk group is in Veritas.\n<ol>\n	<li>Right click on the disk group you just created and select properties.</li>\n	<li>Click the properties tab.</li>\n	<li>On the line named \"DiskGroupName\" Type the name of the disk group, as it appear in Veritas into the Value field.</li>\n	<li>Click ok.</li>\n</ol>\nYou should probably rename the application and resource you just created so they are easily identifiable later.\n\nFor me this didn\'t work right away due to some sort of locking that was happening on one of the nodes. A reboot fixed that issue.\n\nUpdate: 2010/05/06 - Started having some problems when bringing the Volume Manager Disk Group online. The act of bringing the resource online seems to crash the cluster! I\'m currently talking with our storage team about the issue. We have identified a FUGLY work around. Put the disk group in a deported state. Then right after creating the Volume Manager Disk Group cluster resource, detach it from the cluster application so it\'s in available storage. Then you can bring it online...eventually. By eventually I mean that it seems to be very picky about when you enter the DiskGroupName.\n\nWe are still trying to figure out what\'s going on with this and will probably be contacting Symantec support on the issue due to the cluster crashing implication.\n\nUpdate 2012/05/13 - I know it\'s been a while but I noticed I never brought this post to a conclusion. (my bad).

I checked the portalsuperuseraccount and portalsuperreaderaccount properties and sure enough I had followed my documentation for creating a web application to the letter. Unfortunately my documentation assumes I\'m creating a claims authentication based web application. DOH! I checked using:\n<pre class=\"brush: powershell; gutter: true\">$wa = get-spwebapplication webappURL\n$wa.properties</pre>\nSure enough I had set the values of the properties to be the claim ID for the users.

The WFEs in the environment have 16 GB of ram each. No way am I buying that reason. Today I remembered, this is the only web application in our farm that is setup to use windows classic authentication. I checked the portalsuperuseraccount and portalsuperreaderaccount properties and sure enough I had followed my documentation for creating a web application to the letter. Unfortunately my documentation assumes I\'m creating a claims authentication based web application. DOH! I checked using:\n<pre class=\"brush: powershell; gutter: true\">$wa = get-spwebapplication webappURL\n$wa.properties</pre>\nSure enough I had set the values of the properties to be the claim ID for the users. In other words they appeared with the i:0#.w| prefix. I ran the following to correctly set them.\n<pre class=\"brush: powershell; gutter: true\">$wa = Get-SPWebApplication webappURL\n$wa.properties[&quot;portalsuperuseraccount&quot;] = &quot;domain\\svcsp-cacheuser&quot;\n$wa.properties[&quot;portalsuperreaderaccount&quot;] = &quot;domain\\svcsp-cachereader&quot;\n$wa.update()</pre>\nThe change should take effect right away and not cause downtime.\n\nIn retrospect the some of the text in the events do kind of lean toward the issue being something with the publishing features. However it was hard to get past the \"Server out of memory\" error. I\'m sure that makes some kind of sense on a technical level but it\'s a very vague and misleading error. I hope this helps someone.","SharePoint 2010: Server out of memory in ULS log?","","inherit","open","open","","96-autosave","","","2012-05-23 20:27:28","2012-05-23 20:27:28","","96","http://practicalkungfu.net/?p=98","0","revision","","0");

INSERT INTO wp_posts VALUES("113","1","2012-07-11 16:26:13","2012-07-11 16:26:13","I decided to make this a two part post since I really wasn\'t happy with the basic script I wrote in the first place. I\'ve streamlined it by adding a WFE server list as an array and added some powershell remoting as well as a method for remote Forefront configuration deployment without Forefront Protection Server Management Console 2010.\n\nFirst if you don\'t know how enabling poweshell remoting is pretty easy for a basic config. To enable PS remoting on Server 2008 R2, just run the following command from an elevated command prompt:\n<pre class=\"brush: powershell; gutter: true\">Enable-PSRemoting -Force</pre>\nYou will need to do this on all your WFEs.\n\nThe previous version of the script was really way to basic. It had to be run from a the same WFE every time because of the way robocopy was used in it. It also didn\'t deploy the config. This isn\'t so much of an issue if you want to use Forefront Protection Server Management Console 2010 for deployment. The console does allow you to select which parts of the config you want to deploy, however the config on all WFEs should be the same under normal circumstances so I personally don\'t get much out of that.\n\nI changed the $filename variable to include the computer name the config change was created on. I can\'t see wanting it right now, but thought it would be nice to have. Just after that I created an array of all the server names. The $servers variable is the one you should change and put your SharePoint WFE servers into.\n\nI also replaced the robocopy commands with a single robocopy in a for each loop that loops through the $servers array. I also used $env:computername for the source server so it won\'t matter which server you make your config changes on.\n\nThe last foreach loop also loops through the $servers array.

With at least a few servers and many mailbox DBs per server. Now say you had some kind of nasty event in your environment that caused a failover that has caused all or some of your DBs to become active on your DR/passive nodes. How do you get them back where they are supposed to be.\n\nThis may be old news to many of you but SP1 for exchange introduced a few new powershell scripts. One being RedistributeActiveDatabases.ps1. RedistributeActiveDatabases.ps1 will redistribute your mailbox DBs based on activation preference. It\'s very nice for use when patching mailbox server or if there is a failover event. This script along with a few others are located at C:\\Program Files\\Microsoft\\Exchange Server\\V14\\Scripts. I run it with the following:\n<pre class=\"brush: powershell; gutter: false\">RedistributeActiveDatabases.ps1 -DagName DAG01 -BalanceDbsByActivationPreference -ShowFinalDatabaseDistribution -Confirm:$False</pre>\nMore info on this script at <a href=\"http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd335158.aspx\">http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd335158.aspx</a>.\n\nThere is one problem with RedistributeActiveDatabases.ps1. It requires organization admin rights to get the DAG information. Thats no good if you don\'t have org admin rights.\n<div>*The following does require designing your DB names with information you can filter on. For example, have some kind of identifying string in the name so you can tell which server should be the home server. For example DB names could be like, MB01DB01, MB01DB02, etc... So MB01 would denote the server name and the DB01 part would be the DB number on that server.</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>\n<pre class=\"brush: powershell; gutter: false\">$destserver = &quot;MB01&quot;\n$DBs = Get-MailboxDatabase  | where {$_.Name -like &quot;MB01DB*&quot;}\n\nforeach ($db in $DBs) {\n    Move-ActiveMailboxDatabase $db -ActivateOnServer $destserver -Confirm:$false\n}</pre>\n</div>\n<div>The script is pretty simple. You specify a destination server and modify the prefix of the DB names. Then run it from the exchange powershell console. You would need to run this for each of your mailbox servers. You could also loop through the mailbox server in your environment then loop through the DBs and move them. I chose not to do that so I could use this as more of a paste into the console type of script.</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>There are probably a few ways to do this. It\'s just a matter of personal preference.</div>","Exchange 2010: Re-balance DBs in a DAG","","publish","open","open","","exchange-2010-re-balance-dbs-in-a-dag","","","2012-07-22 02:39:06","2012-07-22 02:39:06","","0","http://practicalkungfu.net/?p=157","0","post","","0");

The user profile service application can get complicated and temperamental. I\'m sure I missed some stuff, but I\'ll add updates to the post as they come up. And as always if I\'ve posted something thats glaringly wrong, call me out on it. :)\n\nFor some reason this topic was hard to find information on. Especially relating on how to properly use the msDS-SourceObjectDN attribute in relation to SharePoint. This post is for those people who have environments that have two domains/forests (logon and resource) for either separation of data or you may be getting ready for a migration. (two or more forests setup with trusts)\n\n<strong>Requirements</strong>\n<ul>\n	<li>Permission: Domain Admin – to setup the permission in AD</li>\n	<li>Permission: Enterprise Admin – to setup the permission in AD (for netbios support)</li>\n	<li>Pre-populate the msDS-SourceObjectDN attribute for each user in the resource forest\n<ul>\n	<li>You can use tools like Forefront Identity Manager or powershell to set the attribute. Personal I’d recommend powershell if you don’t have FIM in place. It’s SOOO much easier in comparison.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n	<li>One account for each AD forest your are going to sync with. Each a account should be created in their respective forest.</li>\n</ul>\n<strong>AD Permissions</strong>\n\nIn active directory users and computers right click on the root of the forest and select Properties. Click the security tab. Add the Resource forest account and grant it the Replicating Directory Changes permission.\n\n<a href=\"http://practicalkungfu.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/ADpermissions.png\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-130\" title=\"ADpermissions\" src=\"http://practicalkungfu.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/ADpermissions.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"380\" height=\"262\" /></a>\n\nDo the same for the logon forest with the account for the logon domain sync connection.\n\n*Additional permission may be needed if your netbios domain name doesn’t match your DNS name.\n\n<strong>Create the UPA Application and Proxy</strong>\n\nThere are numerous scripts and walk-throughs for doing this so I’m not going to go over that much. Just create a UPA and UPA proxy per normal.\n\nThe only gotcha here is if your netbios domain name on one or both of your domains doesn’t match it’s DNS name. See the below section if you fall into that case.\n\n<strong>Setting up the UPA for netbios Support</strong>\n\nThis is only required if one, or both, of your domain’s netbios name doesn’t match the DNS name. FYI, this has to be done before starting the user profile sync service.\n\nTo check to see if NetbiosDomainNames are enabled run the following powershell commands.\n<pre class=\"brush: powershell; gutter: true\">$upsa = Get-SPServiceApplication | where {$_.DisplayName -eq &quot;User Profile Service Application&quot;}\n$upsa.NetBIOSDomainNamesEnabled</pre>\nSince this is a new UPA it should return a false. Next run the following:\n<pre class=\"brush: powershell; gutter: true\">$upsa = Get-SPServiceApplication | where {$_.DisplayName -eq &quot;User Profile Service Application&quot;}\n$upsa.NetBIOSDomainNamesEnabled=1\n$upsa.Update()</pre>\nIf you run the commands to check the netbios status again it should return true now.\n\nAdditionally you will need to grant the sync accounts Replicating Directory Changes permissions on the Configuration container using ADSIedit.msc. This will need to be done for both forests even if the netbios condition only applies to one of your forests.\n\nTo start ADSIedit Click Start-&gt;Run and type adsiedit.msc\n\nRight click on ADSI Edit and click Connect To…\n\nIn the pull down for “Select a well known Naming Context” choose Configuration\n\n<a href=\"http://practicalkungfu.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/ADSIsettings.png\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-131\" title=\"ADSIsettings\" src=\"http://practicalkungfu.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/ADSIsettings.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"380\" height=\"291\" /></a>\n\nRight click on the configuration container and select properties. Click the security tab.\n\nAdd your sync account for the relevant domain and give it the Replicating Directory Changes permission just like you did in in ADUC. Do this for both forests.\n\n<strong>Starting the User Profile Sync Service</strong>\n\nAgain this is something that is part of the normal UPA creation process so I’m not going to cover this in detail. The general steps are shown below.\n\nGoto Central Admin-&gt;System Settings-&gt;Services on server\n<ul>\n	<li>Select the server you want to run the sync service from.</li>\n	<li>Click start next to the user profile sync service</li>\n	<li>It will ask your for credentials to use as the service identity. Enter them and click OK.</li>\n	<li>Pray</li>\n</ul>\n<strong>Creating the sync connections</strong>\n\nHere is where things get a little different. You need to setup two sync connections. One will be for pulling the display information (resource forest) for the users (displayname, firstname, manager, etc). The other is for the logon forest, this will be the account actually used by the user (what they login to their machine with).\n\nHow does this work? SharePoint actually makes a connection between the two accounts by looking at the msDS-SourceObjectDN AD attribute in the resource forest. msDS-SourceObjectDN should be populated with the DN of the logon forest’s account.\n\n(If you’re running exchange in a logon/resource domain config chances are you are already doing something similar with the msExchMasterAccountSid to create linked mailboxes. Ask your AD and or Exchange admins, they can probably help get the msDS-SourceObjectDN set on the resource domain.)\n\nGoto Central Admin-&gt;Application Management-&gt;Manage Service Applications-&gt;User Profile Service Application\n<ul>\n	<li>Click Configure Synchronization Connections</li>\n	<li>Add a new connection</li>\n	<li>Set type to Active Directory Resource</li>\n	<li>Enter your forest and sync user information for the resource forest</li>\n	<li>Then select the OUs you want to sync.</li>\n	<li>Click ok</li>\n</ul>\n<div><a href=\"http://practicalkungfu.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/resourceforestconnection.png\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-136\" title=\"resourceforestconnection\" src=\"http://practicalkungfu.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/resourceforestconnection-1024x355.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"584\" height=\"202\" /></a></div>\nSetting up the logon forest connection is almost the same process. Except this time use the Active Directory Logon Data connection type.\n<ul>\n	<li>Set type to Active Directory Logon Data</li>\n	<li>Enter your forest and sync user information for the logon forest</li>\n	<li>Then select the OUs you want to sync.</li>\n	<li>Click ok</li>\n</ul>\n<div><a href=\"http://practicalkungfu.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/logonforestconnection.png\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-137\" title=\"logonforestconnection\" src=\"http://practicalkungfu.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/logonforestconnection-1024x391.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"584\" height=\"222\" /></a></div>\n<strong>Monitoring the sync progress</strong>\n\nAt this point you should be ready to start a full sync, but it’s a good idea to watch the MIISclient to make sure the sync process works.\n\nTo start the client run: \"C:\\Program Files\\Microsoft Office Servers\\14.0\\Synchronization Service\\UIShell\\miisclient.exe\"\n\nNow I have to say this warning. <strong>Never change anything from inside this client. It would be bad.</strong>\n\nNow that the warning is out of the way you can look inside all you want, in fact the FIM client is invaluable for troubleshooting sync issues.\n\nThere are a lot of errors that can appear in here, but the one I’ve come across the most is when you get an operation status of stopped-connectivity. If you click on the job and then look in the connection status window, it should show the name of a domain controller. Click on the name of the DC and a new window will appear. It will show you the cause of the error. In this case it’s usually Replication ccess was denied, which means the replicating directory changes permission aren’t setup correctly.\n\n<a href=\"http://practicalkungfu.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/replicationaccessdenied.png\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-138\" title=\"replicationaccessdenied\" src=\"http://practicalkungfu.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/replicationaccessdenied.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"261\" height=\"243\" /></a>\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<strong>Parting notes</strong>\n\nBeware sIDHistory:\n\n<a href=\"http://blogs.technet.com/b/rgullick/archive/2010/05/15/sharepoint-people-picker.aspx\">http://blogs.technet.com/b/rgullick/archive/2010/05/15/sharepoint-people-picker.aspx</a>\n\nApparently there is a condition that the people pick will have problems with if you use sIDHistory.I mention it now because if you have a resource and logon forest setup, you may be in the middle of a domain migration. The 10000ft view of this issue is that the people picker searches over two way trusts. It will then see the SID in the sIDHistory attribute on the stub account as well as the original logon account objectSID. This confuses and angers the people picker causing it not be able to resolve users. End result you can\'t set permissions or add users to people and group fields. This could potentially impact my site creation and work flows (probably some other stuff to). You can probably get around this issue by setting the search scope of the people picker for each site collection, however this will get messy fast if you have more that one logon domain.

INSERT INTO wp_posts VALUES("144","1","2012-07-13 18:58:28","2012-07-13 18:58:28","This post will probably be getting some updates as time passes. The user profile service application can get complicated and temperamental. I\'m sure I missed some stuff, but I\'ll add updates to the post as they come up. And as always if I\'ve posted something thats glaringly wrong, call me out on it. :)\n\nFor some reason this topic was hard to find information on. Especially relating on how to properly use the msDS-SourceObjectDN attribute in relation to SharePoint. This post is for those people who have environments that have two domains/forests (logon and resource) for either separation of data or you may be getting ready for a migration. (two or more forests setup with trusts)\n\n<strong>Requirements</strong>\n<ul>\n	<li>Permission: Domain Admin – to setup the permission in AD</li>\n	<li>Permission: Enterprise Admin – to setup the permission in AD (for netbios support)</li>\n	<li>Pre-populate the msDS-SourceObjectDN attribute for each user in the resource forest\n<ul>\n	<li>You can use tools like Forefront Identity Manager or powershell to set the attribute. Personal I’d recommend powershell if you don’t have FIM in place. It’s SOOO much easier in comparison.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n	<li>One account for each AD forest your are going to sync with. Each a account should be created in their respective forest.</li>\n</ul>\n<strong>AD Permissions</strong>\n\nIn active directory users and computers right click on the root of the forest and select Properties. Click the security tab. Add the Resource forest account and grant it the Replicating Directory Changes permission.\n\n<a href=\"http://practicalkungfu.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/ADpermissions.png\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-130\" title=\"ADpermissions\" src=\"http://practicalkungfu.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/ADpermissions.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"380\" height=\"262\" /></a>\n\nDo the same for the logon forest with the account for the logon domain sync connection.\n\n*Additional permission may be needed if your netbios domain name doesn’t match your DNS name.\n\n<strong>Create the UPA Application and Proxy</strong>\n\nThere are numerous scripts and walk-throughs for doing this so I’m not going to go over that much. Just create a UPA and UPA proxy per normal.\n\nThe only gotcha here is if your netbios domain name on one or both of your domains doesn’t match it’s DNS name. See the below section if you fall into that case.\n\n<strong>Setting up the UPA for netbios Support</strong>\n\nThis is only required if one, or both, of your domain’s netbios name doesn’t match the DNS name. FYI, this has to be done before starting the user profile sync service.\n\nTo check to see if NetbiosDomainNames are enabled run the following powershell commands.\n<pre class=\"brush: powershell; gutter: true\">$upsa = Get-SPServiceApplication | where {$_.DisplayName -eq &quot;User Profile Service Application&quot;}\n$upsa.NetBIOSDomainNamesEnabled</pre>\nSince this is a new UPA it should return a false. Next run the following:\n<pre class=\"brush: powershell; gutter: true\">$upsa = Get-SPServiceApplication | where {$_.DisplayName -eq &quot;User Profile Service Application&quot;}\n$upsa.NetBIOSDomainNamesEnabled=1\n$upsa.Update()</pre>\nIf you run the commands to check the netbios status again it should return true now.\n\nAdditionally you will need to grant the sync accounts Replicating Directory Changes permissions on the Configuration container using ADSIedit.msc. This will need to be done for both forests even if the netbios condition only applies to one of your forests.\n\nTo start ADSIedit Click Start-&gt;Run and type adsiedit.msc\n\nRight click on ADSI Edit and click Connect To…\n\nIn the pull down for “Select a well known Naming Context” choose Configuration\n\n<a href=\"http://practicalkungfu.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/ADSIsettings.png\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-131\" title=\"ADSIsettings\" src=\"http://practicalkungfu.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/ADSIsettings.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"380\" height=\"291\" /></a>\n\nRight click on the configuration container and select properties. Click the security tab.\n\nAdd your sync account for the relevant domain and give it the Replicating Directory Changes permission just like you did in in ADUC. Do this for both forests.\n\n<strong>Starting the User Profile Sync Service</strong>\n\nAgain this is something that is part of the normal UPA creation process so I’m not going to cover this in detail. The general steps are shown below.\n\nGoto Central Admin-&gt;System Settings-&gt;Services on server\n<ul>\n	<li>Select the server you want to run the sync service from.</li>\n	<li>Click start next to the user profile sync service</li>\n	<li>It will ask your for credentials to use as the service identity. Enter them and click OK.</li>\n	<li>Pray</li>\n</ul>\n<strong>Creating the sync connections</strong>\n\nHere is where things get a little different. You need to setup two sync connections. One will be for pulling the display information (resource forest) for the users (displayname, firstname, manager, etc). The other is for the logon forest, this will be the account actually used by the user (what they login to their machine with).\n\nHow does this work? SharePoint actually makes a connection between the two accounts by looking at the msDS-SourceObjectDN AD attribute in the resource forest. msDS-SourceObjectDN should be populated with the DN of the logon forest’s account.\n\n(If you’re running exchange in a logon/resource domain config chances are you are already doing something similar with the msExchMasterAccountSid to create linked mailboxes. Ask your AD and or Exchange admins, they can probably help get the msDS-SourceObjectDN set on the resource domain.)\n\nGoto Central Admin-&gt;Application Management-&gt;Manage Service Applications-&gt;User Profile Service Application\n<ul>\n	<li>Click Configure Synchronization Connections</li>\n	<li>Add a new connection</li>\n	<li>Set type to Active Directory Resource</li>\n	<li>Enter your forest and sync user information for the resource forest</li>\n	<li>Then select the OUs you want to sync.</li>\n	<li>Click ok</li>\n</ul>\n<div><a href=\"http://practicalkungfu.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/resourceforestconnection.png\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-136\" title=\"resourceforestconnection\" src=\"http://practicalkungfu.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/resourceforestconnection-1024x355.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"584\" height=\"202\" /></a></div>\nSetting up the logon forest connection is almost the same process. Except this time use the Active Directory Logon Data connection type.\n<ul>\n	<li>Set type to Active Directory Logon Data</li>\n	<li>Enter your forest and sync user information for the logon forest</li>\n	<li>Then select the OUs you want to sync.</li>\n	<li>Click ok</li>\n</ul>\n<div><a href=\"http://practicalkungfu.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/logonforestconnection.png\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-137\" title=\"logonforestconnection\" src=\"http://practicalkungfu.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/logonforestconnection-1024x391.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"584\" height=\"222\" /></a></div>\n<strong>Monitoring the sync progress</strong>\n\nAt this point you should be ready to start a full sync, but it’s a good idea to watch the MIISclient to make sure the sync process works.\n\nTo start the client run: \"C:\\Program Files\\Microsoft Office Servers\\14.0\\Synchronization Service\\UIShell\\miisclient.exe\"\n\nNow I have to say this warning. <strong>Never change anything from inside this client. It would be bad.</strong>\n\nNow that the warning is out of the way you can look inside all you want, in fact the FIM client is invaluable for troubleshooting sync issues.\n\nThere are a lot of errors that can appear in here, but the one I’ve come across the most is when you get an operation status of stopped-connectivity. If you click on the job and then look in the connection status window, it should show the name of a domain controller. Click on the name of the DC and a new window will appear. It will show you the cause of the error. In this case it’s usually Replication ccess was denied, which means the replicating directory changes permission aren’t setup correctly.\n\n<a href=\"http://practicalkungfu.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/replicationaccessdenied.png\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-138\" title=\"replicationaccessdenied\" src=\"http://practicalkungfu.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/replicationaccessdenied.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"261\" height=\"243\" /></a>\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<strong>Parting notes</strong>\n\nBeware sIDHistory:\n\n<a href=\"http://blogs.technet.com/b/rgullick/archive/2010/05/15/sharepoint-people-picker.aspx\">http://blogs.technet.com/b/rgullick/archive/2010/05/15/sharepoint-people-picker.aspx</a>\n\nApparently there is a condition that the people pick will have problems with if you use sIDHistory.I mention it now because if you have a resource and logon forest setup, you may be in the middle of a domain migration. The 10000ft view of this issue is that the people picker searches over two way trusts. It will then see the SID in the sIDHistory attribute on the stub account as well as the original logon account objectSID. This confuses and angers the people picker causing it not be able to resolve users. End result you can\'t set permissions or add users to people and group fields. This could potentially impact my site creation and work flows (probably some other stuff to). You can probably get around this issue by setting the search scope of the people picker for each site collection, however this will get messy fast if you have more that one logon domain.

I wasn\'t sure what I was going to do with it. I was just excited about finding an fairly good enterprise level firewall at a ham fest.<br /><br />Fast forward about a year. I came across an article about modding the x750e. After digging deeper I found that people were installing pfsense on them. OMG! I took apart the&nbsp;x750e and sure enough it is essentially just a 1.4 GHz celeron with 512MB ram and and 256MB SanDisk CF card in it. (plus a few other things)<br /><br />I looked around for a how to but all I could find was a bunch of hard to follow forum posts (and one pretty well documented process, but it seemed to be missing some stuff). Not that they were bad information (I mean I was able to get the thing working based of them), but it was all a bit disconnected.<br /><br />So here is my walk through. If I\'m missing anything or if I plain got something wrong please leave a comment and I\'ll fix the post.<br /><br /><b>OS used:</b> Windows XP (for hyperterminal.

However for this I wanted to avoid soldering. :)<br /><br />Remove watchguard supplied CF card (256mb in my case) and insert into CF card reader on your computer. (I used a Dynex card reader from the local electronics store). <b>Disclaimer: you are about to wipe out the factory software that came with your firewall!</b><br /><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\">physdiskwrite freedosbios.img</blockquote>&nbsp;Once it\'s done writing the image,&nbsp;copy X750EB6.BIN to bios directory on cf card if it\'s not already there.

Noise. There is a wonderful little program that someone wrote called WGXepc. It allows you to clock down the fans in software when pfsense boots. Here is the basic setup:<br /><br />Quick note about fan speed.&nbsp;(The default speed is FF. We are going to set the speed to 10. That may be too slow though. You should monitor your environment and set accordingly based on need.)<br /><br />Add the following line to WGXepc.sh<br />/usr/local/etc/rc.d/WGXepc -f 10<br /><br />Connect using WINscp or ther secure copy tool as root and your pfsense admin password.<br /><br />copy WGXepc and WGXepc.sh to using WINSCP:<br />/tmp<br /><br />Login using through SSH (I used putty) with root and your&nbsp;pfsense&nbsp;admin password.<br /><br />Mount FS as read write<br />/etc/rc.conf_mount_rw<br /><br />cp WGXepc /usr/local/bin<br />cp WGXepc.sh /usr/local/etc/rc.d/<br /><br />chmod 0755 /usr/local/bin/WGXepc<br />chmod 0755 /usr/local/etc/rc.d/WGXepc.sh<br /><br />/etc/rc.conf_mount_ro<br /><br />shutdown -r now<br />or<br />run this to set the fan speed now: WGXepc -f 10<br /><br />All changes done with this command are immediate. Also a system update will remove these settings. You will have to reapply them.<br /><br />WGXepc will also control the Arm/Disarm light on the front of the x750e. :)<br /><br />Here are the arguments the command accepts:<br /><br />&nbsp;-f (fan) will return the current fan speed or if followed&nbsp;by a number in hex, 00-FF, will set it.<br />&nbsp;-l (led) will set the arm/disarm to the second argument:<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; red, green, red_flash, green_flash, off<br /><br /><br /><b>Clock down the CPU</b><br />In the web interface goto System-&gt;Advanced-&gt;Miscellaneous.<br />Enable PowerD<br /><br />If you see the following in the system log happening a lot:<br /><blockquote class=\"tr_bq\">kernel: timecounter TSC must not be in use when changing frequencies; change denied</blockquote><br />Add the following to Advanced-&gt;System Tunables to fix the issue.<br /><br />Tunable:&nbsp;kern.timecounter.hardware<br />Value:&nbsp;i8254<br /><br /><b>Sources:</b><br /><a href=\"http://nettechonline.net/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=78:x700-led-fix-pfsense-on-watchguard&amp;catid=49:pfsense-watchguard&amp;Itemid=58\">http://nettechonline.net/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=78:x700-led-fix-pfsense-on-watchguard&amp;catid=49:pfsense-watchguard&amp;Itemid=58</a><br /><a href=\"http://forum.pfsense.org/index.php?topic=32013.65;wap2\">http://forum.pfsense.org/index.php?topic=32013.65;wap2</a><br /><a href=\"http://documentation.dbernhardt.com/pfsense/article.html\">http://documentation.dbernhardt.com/pfsense/article.html</a><br /><a href=\"http://doc.pfsense.org/index.php/Remount_embedded_filesystem_as_read-write\">http://doc.pfsense.org/index.php/Remount_embedded_filesystem_as_read-write</a><br /><br /><br />There you have it. You should have pfsense working on the x750e hardware. Also if you don\'t want to go the full route of flashing a new bios, you can also put Monowall on the 256MB card that comes with the firewall as mentioned before. Monowall requires a lot less space than pfsense. There are some features you won\'t get with Monowall that exist in pfsense UPNP and OS&nbsp;fingerprinting&nbsp;for example, but Monowall is a really solid firewall platform. pfsense was actually forked from Monowall.<br /><br />The most&nbsp;aggravating&nbsp;part of all this work was finding a working computer that still has a COM port. :)<br /><br /><b>Update 2012-02-20: </b>A couple thing to add. First I didn\'t realize this but it appears that there is no way to&nbsp;re-size&nbsp;the tmp volume. This is significant because it\'s one of two volumes on pfsense&nbsp;embedded&nbsp;that is created as a ram disk (the other is var). This is significant because tmp is where squidguard and other packages store their updates/blacklists. Essentially if you are going to use pfsense in an embedded configuration (on CF card for example) then you are setting up for access control type functions only.

You have two domains (or more), you are trying to go through a domain consolidation onto one domain. So you have multiple user domains, an another (main) domain with enabled or disabled user accounts (stub accounts) that correspond to the users out in the user domains. Your Sharepoint 2010 environment exists in this \"main\" domain also. because of this scenario you configured SharePoint to use ADFS claims only (no windows authentication for users)\n\nSummarry:\nDomain1 - main domain, contains stub accounts and the SharePoint 2010 environment.\nDomain2-# - legacy user domains, contains user accounts actually used by the end users.\n\nSharePoint 2010 - setup to use only ADFS claims for user authentication. (No windows auth for users)\n\nIt works, however after we had implemented it we found the following article. <a href=\"http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh706161.aspx\">http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh706161.aspx</a>\n\nToward the bottom is a list of things that don\'t work, or have limited functionality with SAML authentication (ADFS claims) in SharePoint 2010.

For ever user in every subweb, it will lookup the user\'s AD object based on their mail attribute (also stored in SharePoint), and returns their msDS-SourceObjectDN and attributes. The msDS-SourceObjectDN attribute can be used to determine the users home domain which is done in the two IF statements. If the msDS-SourceObjectDN matches the IF statement condition it will change the users identity in SharePoint.

Most noticeably are the domain names, and the $sourceDN comparisons in the IF statements. Also duplicate the IF statements for each domain that you have users in. You will also want to add all service accounts used with SharePoint to the exclusion statement and any others you deem necessary. (You really only need to add the superreader, super writer, and crawl service accounts to the exclusion list, but I though it would be good to add all managed accounts to be safe.</span>\n<span style=\"font-family: \'Segoe UI\', Verdana, Arial;\">\n</span>\n<span style=\"font-family: \'Segoe UI\', Verdana, Arial;\">Before or after running the script (I did this before) change the authentication for the web application to NTLM or kerberos claims, (disabling the ADFS provider).</span>\n<span style=\"font-family: \'Segoe UI\', Verdana, Arial;\">\n</span>\n<span style=\"font-family: \'Segoe UI\', Verdana, Arial;\">The script may take a long time to run depending on the size of your environment so i\'d recommend running this after hours on a weekend.

(so will Exchange 2010 and granting access to shared mailboxes). I\'d recommend this post. <a href=\"http://blogs.technet.com/b/rgullick/archive/2010/05/15/sharepoint-people-picker.aspx\">http://blogs.technet.com/b/rgullick/archive/2010/05/15/sharepoint-people-picker.aspx</a> It explains the issue with SIDhistory very well. You can get around the SIDHistory issue by not using the people picker and just typing in users in the format domain2\\username and then clicking the resolve button. Although I don\'t think thats a realistic option.\n\nUpdate 2012-4-16: we ran this in in production. It seems to have worked pretty well. I\'ve updated the script though because of some bad programming on my part. Apparently it\'s important to null out your variables if they are going to be reused in a for loop. :) Needless to say there were some issues, but happily not as many as there could have been. I\'ll updating the script to reflect these additions. I think I also need to add some logic to detect if the get-ADuser returns nothing exit the if statement. I\'ll update the script once I get it figured out.\n\n&nbsp;",">SharePoint 2010 Changing from SAML Claims to Windows Claims","","inherit","open","open","","63-revision-3","","","2012-04-16 21:34:32","2012-04-16 21:34:32","","63","http://practicalkungfu.net/2012/04/16/63-revision-3/","0","revision","","0");

With at least a few servers and many mailbox DBs per server. Now say you had some kind of nasty event in your environment that caused a failover that has caused all or some of your DBs to become active on your DR/passive nodes. How do you get them back where they are supposed to be.\n\nThis may be old news to many of you but SP1 for exchange introduced a few new powershell scripts. One being RedistributeActiveDatabases.ps1. RedistributeActiveDatabases.ps1 will redistribute your mailbox DBs based on activation preference. It\'s very nice for use when patching mailbox server or if there is a failover event. This script along with a few others are located at C:\\Program Files\\Microsoft\\Exchange Server\\V14\\Scripts. I run it with the following:\n<pre class=\"brush: powershell; gutter: false\">RedistributeActiveDatabases.ps1 -DagName DAG01 -BalanceDbsByActivationPreference -ShowFinalDatabaseDistribution -Confirm:$False</pre>\nMore info on this script at <a href=\"http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd335158.aspx\">http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd335158.aspx</a>.\n\nThere is one problem with RedistributeActiveDatabases.ps1. It requires organization admin rights to get the DAG information. Thats no good if you don\'t have org admin.\n<div>*The following does require designing your DB names with information you can filter on. For example, have some kind of identifying string in the name so you can tell which server should be the home server. For example DB names could be like, MB01DB01, MB01DB02, etc... So MB01 would denote the server name and the DB01 part would be the DB number on that server.</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>\n<pre class=\"brush: powershell; gutter: false\">$destserver = &quot;MB01&quot;\n$DBs = Get-MailboxDatabase  | where {$_.Name -like &quot;MB01DB*&quot;}\n\nforeach ($db in $DBs) {\n    Move-ActiveMailboxDatabase $db -ActivateOnServer $destserver -Confirm:$false\n}</pre>\n</div>\n<div>The script is pretty simple. You specify a destination server and modify the prefix of the DB names. Then run it from the exchange powershell console. You would need to run this for each of your mailbox servers. You could also loop through the mailbox server in your environment then loop through the DBs and move them. I chose not to do that so I could use this as more of a paste into the console type of script.</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>There are probably a few ways to do this.

INSERT INTO wp_posts VALUES("160","1","2012-07-15 01:04:17","2012-07-15 01:04:17","This post will probably be getting some updates as time passes. The user profile service application can get complicated and temperamental. I\'m sure I missed some stuff, but I\'ll add updates to the post as they come up. And as always if I\'ve posted something thats glaringly wrong, call me out on it. :)\n\nFor some reason this topic was hard to find information on. Especially relating on how to properly use the msDS-SourceObjectDN attribute in relation to SharePoint. This post is for those people who have environments that have two domains/forests (logon and resource) for either separation of data or you may be getting ready for a migration. (two or more forests setup with trusts)\n\n<strong>Requirements</strong>\n<ul>\n	<li>Permission: Domain Admin – to setup the permission in AD</li>\n	<li>Permission: Enterprise Admin – to setup the permission in AD (for netbios support)</li>\n	<li>Pre-populate the msDS-SourceObjectDN attribute for each user in the resource forest\n<ul>\n	<li>You can use tools like Forefront Identity Manager or powershell to set the attribute. Personal I’d recommend powershell if you don’t have FIM in place. It’s SOOO much easier in comparison.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n	<li>One account for each AD forest your are going to sync with. Each a account should be created in their respective forest.</li>\n</ul>\n<strong>AD Permissions</strong>\n\nIn active directory users and computers right click on the root of the forest and select Properties. Click the security tab. Add the Resource forest account and grant it the Replicating Directory Changes permission.\n\n<a href=\"http://practicalkungfu.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/ADpermissions.png\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-130\" title=\"ADpermissions\" src=\"http://practicalkungfu.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/ADpermissions.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"380\" height=\"262\" /></a>\n\nDo the same for the logon forest with the account for the logon domain sync connection.\n\n*Additional permission may be needed if your netbios domain name doesn’t match your DNS name.\n\n<strong>Create the UPA Application and Proxy</strong>\n\nThere are numerous scripts and walk-throughs for doing this so I’m not going to go over that much. Just create a UPA and UPA proxy per normal.\n\nThe only gotcha here is if your netbios domain name on one or both of your domains doesn’t match it’s DNS name. See the below section if you fall into that case.\n\n<strong>Setting up the UPA for netbios Support</strong>\n\nThis is only required if one, or both, of your domain’s netbios name doesn’t match the DNS name. FYI, this has to be done before starting the user profile sync service.\n\nTo check to see if NetbiosDomainNames are enabled run the following powershell commands.\n<pre class=\"brush: powershell; gutter: true\">$upsa = Get-SPServiceApplication | where {$_.DisplayName -eq &quot;User Profile Service Application&quot;}\n$upsa.NetBIOSDomainNamesEnabled</pre>\nSince this is a new UPA it should return a false. Next run the following:\n<pre class=\"brush: powershell; gutter: true\">$upsa = Get-SPServiceApplication | where {$_.DisplayName -eq &quot;User Profile Service Application&quot;}\n$upsa.NetBIOSDomainNamesEnabled=1\n$upsa.Update()</pre>\nIf you run the commands to check the netbios status again it should return true now.\n\nAdditionally you will need to grant the sync accounts Replicating Directory Changes permissions on the Configuration container using ADSIedit.msc. This will need to be done for both forests even if the netbios condition only applies to one of your forests.\n\nTo start ADSIedit Click Start-&gt;Run and type adsiedit.msc\n\nRight click on ADSI Edit and click Connect To…\n\nIn the pull down for “Select a well known Naming Context” choose Configuration\n\n<a href=\"http://practicalkungfu.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/ADSIsettings.png\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-131\" title=\"ADSIsettings\" src=\"http://practicalkungfu.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/ADSIsettings.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"380\" height=\"291\" /></a>\n\nRight click on the configuration container and select properties. Click the security tab.\n\nAdd your sync account for the relevant domain and give it the Replicating Directory Changes permission just like you did in in ADUC. Do this for both forests.\n\n<strong>Starting the User Profile Sync Service</strong>\n\nAgain this is something that is part of the normal UPA creation process so I’m not going to cover this in detail. The general steps are shown below.\n\nGoto Central Admin-&gt;System Settings-&gt;Services on server\n<ul>\n	<li>Select the server you want to run the sync service from.</li>\n	<li>Click start next to the user profile sync service</li>\n	<li>It will ask your for credentials to use as the service identity. Enter them and click OK.</li>\n	<li>Pray</li>\n</ul>\n<strong>Creating the sync connections</strong>\n\nHere is where things get a little different. You need to setup two sync connections. One will be for pulling the display information (resource forest) for the users (displayname, firstname, manager, etc). The other is for the logon forest, this will be the account actually used by the user (what they login to their machine with).\n\nHow does this work? SharePoint actually makes a connection between the two accounts by looking at the msDS-SourceObjectDN AD attribute in the resource forest. msDS-SourceObjectDN should be populated with the DN of the logon forest’s account.\n\n(If you’re running exchange in a logon/resource domain config chances are you are already doing something similar with the msExchMasterAccountSid to create linked mailboxes. Ask your AD and or Exchange admins, they can probably help get the msDS-SourceObjectDN set on the resource domain.)\n\nGoto Central Admin-&gt;Application Management-&gt;Manage Service Applications-&gt;User Profile Service Application\n<ul>\n	<li>Click Configure Synchronization Connections</li>\n	<li>Add a new connection</li>\n	<li>Set type to Active Directory Resource</li>\n	<li>Enter your forest and sync user information for the resource forest</li>\n	<li>Then select the OUs you want to sync.</li>\n	<li>Click ok</li>\n</ul>\n<div><a href=\"http://practicalkungfu.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/resourceforestconnection.png\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-136\" title=\"resourceforestconnection\" src=\"http://practicalkungfu.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/resourceforestconnection-1024x355.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"584\" height=\"202\" /></a></div>\nSetting up the logon forest connection is almost the same process. Except this time use the Active Directory Logon Data connection type.\n<ul>\n	<li>Set type to Active Directory Logon Data</li>\n	<li>Enter your forest and sync user information for the logon forest</li>\n	<li>Then select the OUs you want to sync.</li>\n	<li>Click ok</li>\n</ul>\n<div><a href=\"http://practicalkungfu.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/logonforestconnection.png\"><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-137\" title=\"logonforestconnection\" src=\"http://practicalkungfu.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/logonforestconnection-1024x391.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"584\" height=\"222\" /></a></div>\n<strong>Monitoring the sync progress</strong>\n\nAt this point you should be ready to start a full sync, but it’s a good idea to watch the MIISclient to make sure the sync process works.\n\nTo start the client run: \"C:\\Program Files\\Microsoft Office Servers\\14.0\\Synchronization Service\\UIShell\\miisclient.exe\"\n\nNow I have to say this warning. <strong>Never change anything from inside this client. It would be bad.</strong>\n\nNow that the warning is out of the way you can look inside all you want, in fact the FIM client is invaluable for troubleshooting sync issues.\n\nThere are a lot of errors that can appear in here, but the one I’ve come across the most is when you get an operation status of stopped-connectivity. If you click on the job and then look in the connection status window, it should show the name of a domain controller. Click on the name of the DC and a new window will appear. It will show you the cause of the error. In this case it’s usually Replication ccess was denied, which means the replicating directory changes permission aren’t setup correctly.\n\n<a href=\"http://practicalkungfu.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/replicationaccessdenied.png\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-138\" title=\"replicationaccessdenied\" src=\"http://practicalkungfu.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/replicationaccessdenied.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"261\" height=\"243\" /></a>\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<strong>Parting notes</strong>\n\nBeware sIDHistory:\n\n<a href=\"http://blogs.technet.com/b/rgullick/archive/2010/05/15/sharepoint-people-picker.aspx\">http://blogs.technet.com/b/rgullick/archive/2010/05/15/sharepoint-people-picker.aspx</a>\n\nApparently there is a condition that the people pick will have problems with if you use sIDHistory.I mention it now because if you have a resource and logon forest setup, you may be in the middle of a domain migration. The 10000ft view of this issue is that the people picker searches over two way trusts. It will then see the SID in the sIDHistory attribute on the stub account as well as the original logon account objectSID. This confuses and angers the people picker causing it not be able to resolve users. End result you can\'t set permissions or add users to people and group fields. This could potentially impact my site creation and work flows (probably some other stuff to). You can probably get around this issue by setting the search scope of the people picker for each site collection, however this will get messy fast if you have more that one logon domain.

First it declares a function that will be used to generate a random and complex 15 character password. (handy if your security policy requires such things. most do.) I really wish I could take credit for this function. I got it off the internet, but I can\'t remember where. If this function looks familiar I apologize for the lack of a source list. Please leave a link in the comments back to the original if anyone has seen it before.\n\nNext the the list of users to be created is stored in the $users array. This is just the list of users I like to use for a farm. Your mileage may vary. Also at this point we tell the script where to create the new users.\n\nThe foreach loop generates a password and sets various attributes and properties that are common for service accounts, Password never expires, cannot change password, enabled, etc...\n\nAfter each user is created it outputs the username and the password for each copying.\n\nThere is more I could probably do with this, like create security groups, but the situation I needed this for today didn\'t really call for that.

A long time ago I did a post on how to access OAB and ILO information, through an exposed XML file, using powershell. While cool, it was missing some info, like being able to tell the name of a server thats in a slot. Today I decided to revisit the subject from the opposite direction. Give a server name and see what comes out. Here is what I ended up with. (for this to work ILO and OAB must be setup.)\n<pre class=\"brush: powershell; gutter: false\">$server = &quot;servername&quot;\n\n$chassis = (Get-WmiObject HP_BladeEnclosureCS -computername $server -namespace root\\HPQ).ManagementIPAddress\n$chassisaddress = &quot;http://&quot; + $chassis + &quot;/xmldata?item=All&quot;\n$doc = New-Object System.Xml.XmlDocument\n$doc.Load($chassisaddress)\n\n$Chassisinfo = @()\n\n$obj = New-Object System.Object\n$obj | Add-Member -type NoteProperty -Name Name -Value $server\n$obj | Add-Member -type NoteProperty -Name Model -Value (get-wmiobject -computername $server win32_computersystem).Model\n$obj | Add-Member -type NoteProperty -Name ServerSerial -Value (Get-WmiObject -computername $server win32_Bios).SerialNumber\n$obj | Add-Member -type NoteProperty -Name ServerIP -Value (Test-Connection $server -Count 1).IPV4Address.IPAddressToString\n$obj | Add-Member -type NoteProperty -Name ChassisName -Value (Get-WmiObject HP_BladeEnclosureCS -computername $server -namespace root\\HPQ).Name\n$obj | Add-Member -type NoteProperty -Name ChassisSlot -Value (Get-WmiObject HP_BladeCSLocation -computername $server -namespace root\\HPQ).PhysicalPosition\n$obj | Add-Member -type NoteProperty -Name ChassisRack -Value $doc.RIMP.INFRA2.RACK #rack location\n$obj | Add-Member -type NoteProperty -Name ChassisMgmtURL -Value (Get-WmiObject HP_BladeEnclosureCS -computername $server -namespace root\\HPQ).ManagementURL\n$obj | Add-Member -type NoteProperty -Name ChassisIP -Value (Get-WmiObject HP_BladeEnclosureCS -computername $server -namespace root\\HPQ).ManagementIPAddress\n$obj | Add-Member -type NoteProperty -Name ChassisSerial -Value (Get-WmiObject HP_BladeEnclosureCS -computername $server -namespace root\\HPQ).SerialNumber\n$Chassisinfo += $obj\n\n$Chassisinfo</pre>\nSo most of this is wmi calls to the root\\HPQ namespace where all things HP live. I\'m also using Test-Connection to output the server IP. And I\'m using the previous XML method I mentioned before to get the chassis rack location (because apparently the blade slot is available through wmi but not the rack location...). The output should be a nice report with the following information.\n<pre class=\"brush: text; gutter: false\">Name           : servername\nModel          : ProLiant BL465c G7\nServerSerial   : 2394jsdf23\nServerIP       : 10.0.0.52\nChassisName    : Chassis42\nChassisSlot    : 14\nChassisRack    : 19E\nChassisMgmtURL : http://Chassis42/index.html\nChassisIP      : 10.1.0.52\nChassisSerial  : USE3487294</pre>\nThe information above is fake but it should five you an idea of what the output should look like.\n\nUpdate: Ok so after trying this script with a few more servers, it becomes apparent that it only works with specific setups.

The main foreach loop in this section loops through each site collection.

If it doesn\'t exist then it adds an entry for the site.\n\nThe second section of the script handles site deletions. It gets all entries from the directory list and checks to see if a site collection exists at the given URL. If it doesn\'t it deletes the entry from the list.\n\nOnce the script has run, you can add additional columns to the list through the SharePoint web interface to track other information with each site. Since only object model data for the precreated columns is updated, additional added data will not be affected during additional runs. But new sites will continue to be added to the list and deleted sites removed. This can also be modified to work with the blog directory idea from part 2 of this series.","SharePoint 2010: Site Directories (Dynamic) - Part 3","","publish","open","open","","sharepoint-2010-site-directories-dynamic-part-3","","","2012-08-23 10:31:36","2012-08-23 15:31:36","","0","http://practicalkungfu.net/?p=186","0","post","","0");

Since only object model data for the precreated columns is updated, additional added data will not be affected during additional runs. But new sites will continue to be added to the list and deleted sites removed.

If it doesn\'t, then the script creates it. This is the same process as the last two scripts.\n\nThe next section handles updates and adds to the list. Get-SPSite returns all site collections. The main foreach loop in this section loops through each site collection. It then uses two other foreach statements to check each item thats currently in the list against the current site collection in the loop iteration. If it exists it updates the specified columns. If it doesn\'t exist then it adds an entry for the site.\n\nThe second section of the script handles site deletions. It gets all entries from the directory list and checks to see if a site collection exists at the given URL. if it doesn\'t it deletes the entry from the list.","SharePoint 2010: Site Directories (Dynamic) - Part 3","","inherit","open","open","","186-revision-4","","","2012-08-23 10:28:38","2012-08-23 15:28:38","","186","http://practicalkungfu.net/2012/08/23/186-revision-4/","0","revision","","0");
